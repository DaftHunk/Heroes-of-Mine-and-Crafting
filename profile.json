JEI will be hidden.\n\n## What does EMI bring to the table?\n\nOf course EMI comes with every feature you'd come to expect from the outset, viewing recipes, favoriting items, searching, and the like. But what's new that EMI offers?\n\n* A craftable mode for **quickly crafting** any recipes you're able to make, usable by toggle or as a config for empty searches\n* **Recipes** can be **favorited** with items, and also can be used to quickly craft at a button press\n* A **recipe tree** for breaking down the cost of a complex craft, showing you **every step**, how many **base ingredients** you need, and what you'll have leftover\n* A **recipe tree crafting mode**, counting up the materials and steps you need to be complete to finish a task, including **synthetic favorites** in your sidebar you can use to **craft every step** for exactly as much as you need\n* Smart display of **tags**, with translations, models, and tooltips, showing you ingredients at a glance, such as \"Planks\" instead of slowly rotating through every plank in the game.\n* Smart breakdowns of base costs, letting recipe trees automatically break down to base ingredients, and letting you define **your own defaults** as you play\n* **Tooltips** for recipes, tags, and ingredients showing you what will be crafted, and what makes up an ingredient\n* Binds for quick crafting **straight into your inventory or cursor**, one or many at a time, in conjunction with recipes favorites or the craftable mode\n* A **clean** and **modern** API, built from the ground up to be simple, powerful, and suit all of EMI's features\n* **Zero third party dependencies**. EMI only requires standard, first party Fabric/Quilt APIs\n\n\n## What does EMI stand for?\nIt doesn't, it's not an acronym. Or maybe it's an acronym without a meaning? If it makes you more comfortable, you can pick one from the list below, or make your own up.\n\n* Emi Memy Imi\n* Exhaustively Many Items\n* Explicitly Mandated Items\n* Endless Material

with Fabric.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric.

height=\"59\" /><br />\n<b>An overhaul of the main End Island where the dragon fight takes place!</b>\n<p>Obsidian pillars, End gateways, the spawn platform, and the portal itself in the middle of the island have all been redesigned. Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting.**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting system on client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will remain effective on client side only if given server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of my mod, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n \n## Installation and Use:\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric, just download the version for respective modloader. It can be installed on either client, server, or both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present at:\n\n**1. Only Client:** Client will refuse to send account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof they were actually sent from your account. Server will relay them unless `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to true in server options (which it is by default since 1.19.1), in which case you will not be able to join, unless you agree to send signed messages (the mod will supply warning screen);\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable player to system message conversion in config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signature will be stripped on client side before sending messages to server, server will make no attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough the mod can function when present on only one of the sides, it can be configured to demand itself to be installed on another side in order to play. This way you can install it on server and require all clients that join to have this mod in order to have full functionality, but can also leave it server-only if you prefer. Configuration files are located in <u>NoChatReports</u> subfolder of default config folder.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on client, this mod will disable telemetry (similarly to how [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make Velocity compatible with this mod, set `force-key-authentication = false` in `velocity.toml`. Thanks to [MrMelon54](https://github.com/MrMelon54) for pointing this out.\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to chat encryption, you can watch it to learn how to use it (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make No Chat Reports on client recognize servers with your software as safe. I wrote [a small article about this](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status). For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

We simply add onto Complementary so we obviously don't fall into the green zone. We have had many conversations about this topic with Emin and came to a mutual agreement to distribute it through a patcher where none of Emin's code gets distributed (and by that not breaking the license) and the user has to have Complementary Shaders installed in order to get our add-on. All parties profit from this method.\n## When does Euphoria Patches update?\nWe actually update the add-on with every dev release Emin releases on [<ins>Patreon</ins>](https://www.patreon.com/emingt), meaning that when he releases the public version, the add-on should come shortly after!\n\n### If any more questions arise, just ask in the [<ins>#euphoria-patches</ins>](https://discord.com/invite/985QQxVQZF) channel on the Complementary Discord.\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\nSpecial thanks to Emin the developer of Complementary Shaders, Elysia (Stelleblazer) for the Euphoria Patches banner and all our testers on Discord! This project would have been impossible without you!\n","published":"2023-09-10T10:32:47.834935Z","updated":"2024-01-08T00:16:07.089376Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":115557,"followers":255,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["4cGyDflW","mr3YRPT4","AwNQHuyh","yndLJAOm","3mld4BGc","NLHCR8js","3d9gByqp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4H6sumDB/0f8eaada0050e6ffc2d28ab3002953c644ad0159.png"},"version":{"id":"NLHCR8js","project_id":"4H6sumDB","author_id":"xzDVs8jA","featured":true,"name":"Euphoria Patcher 0.3.0-fabric","version_number":"0.3.0-fabric","changelog":"- Updated to Euphoria Patches 1.2\n- Reworked a lot of internal code in the Patcher","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-08T00:11:24.267962Z","downloads":32127,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"df10663f848f6185f20fdda843af793ea5f1ae4d14ecd70807d702c31a64f0530052b4dbb8684c1f85430ff0186a1c9a6784d9fe62de16fa36fa3050596bddd5","sha1":"c2c47f5da0a29fc7cfbacad7f20bc4e157e25456"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4H6sumDB/versions/NLHCR8js/EuphoriaPatcher-0.3.0-fabric.jar","filename":"EuphoriaPatcher-0.3.0-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":297661,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"HVnmMxH1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"R6NEzAwj","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"IdHtb81r","user":{"id":"xzDVs8jA","username":"isuewo","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53264315?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-06-27T14:04:42.806262Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Also Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"IdHtb81r","user":{"id":"Whu2Z1RB","username":"SpacEagle17","name":"SpacEagle17","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46494907?v=4","bio":"All important links: https://linktr.ee/SpacEagle17","created":"2021-05-02T10:55:35.648359Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"EuphoriaPatcher-0.3.0-fabric.jar"},"mods\\iris-mc1.20.1-1.6.17.jar":{"sha512":"71fcb0cc6274b1991f8361ca0e6b3717428bef1c8cff73ef0420d1dd431d00736060b73105490f980e4fb3173c179140bda74e9f40460704e417558583c7bfb0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"YL57xq9U","slug":"iris","project_type":"mod","team":"1HMZl6Mn","title":"Iris Shaders","description":"A modern shaders mod for Minecraft intended to be compatible with existing OptiFine shader packs","body":"# IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DISTANT HORIZONS COMPATIBILITY, THIS IS NOT IT.\n\n![Iris: An open-source shaders mod compatible with OptiFine shaderpacks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IrisShaders/Iris/trunk/docs/banner.png)\n\n## Links\n\n* **Visit [our website](https://irisshaders.dev) for downloads and pretty screenshots!**\n* **Visit [the shaders section](https://modrinth.com/shaders) to find shader packs!**\n* Visit [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/jQJnav2jPu) to chat about the mod and get support!

[OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - Developer\n- [MoonTidez](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Logo designer\n\n####

Block Entities","description":"Reduce FPS lag with block entities, as well as customize them with resource packs","body":"## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)","published":"2021-03-01T00:33:17.073472Z","updated":"2023-11-26T00:58:42.011781Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1240384,"followers":2865,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["tUbREtJR","J7Zc989q","l4eXcVcY","oiMCXKDH","HHqDCd5p","bndJ1Eq5","Zl4ETunR","ILuyoK6c","qbUAJjs9","VOB3iJkd","5FTTHyNq","88qNYjJz","Id00LoSl","s76PBY7D","fZx04xgT","6NvQpIBY","fJLBqbZ5","Xdo5ZiRc","i3v1Skck","eIFo7wvq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"i3v1Skck","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":true,"name":"EBE v0.9 for 1.20.1, 1.20","version_number":"0.9+1.20","changelog":"- Update to 1.20(.1)\n- Enhanced decorated pots","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-26T05:15:05.839603Z","downloads":599394,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7e8b402fd25efd396bc7f0f25a663808ae9890accc227850c454dfcdc975657f22afceb15878e781485622434a6f6d60aff2a60264aa4425edd52ebe052a0de5","sha1":"61cfe50f69f8ef9e3640c0269ef158870f5b0410"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/i3v1Skck/enhancedblockentities-0.9%2B1.20.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":490690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"FLGCXPFi","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O79BATDr","user":{"id":"WH9NfS5R","username":"FoundationGames","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43485105?v=4","bio":"download my mod please","created":"2020-10-24T21:26:35.640180Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar"},"resourcepacks\\crops-3d.zip":{"sha512":"8ef5e0e9237ceca4517b0c72edbc383c6c4e834cd5532be6e7b4ac9b3dad2f6793975236e8b2e5c60d667b6b577227dff8fa3804240b11eaa6ab43672ebba525","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"PgpTtNoI","slug":"3d-crops","project_type":"resourcepack","team":"vu0mx9lt","title":"3D crops Revamped","description":"Makes minecraft crops 3D","body":"Tired of your flat 2D farms?

Critical striking is completely rng based, powered by secondary attributes.\n\n## 📦 Content\n\n### Entity Attributes:\n\n- Spell Power, one for each specific magic school (for example: `spell_power:fire`)\n- Spell critical chance (id: `spell_power:critical_chance`)\n- Spell critical damage (id: `spell_power:critical_damage`)\n- Spell haste (id: `spell_power:haste`), can be used to quicken spell casting or cooldowns\n\n### Status Effects:\n\n- One specifically for each introduced attribute, with a matching id (for example: `spell_power:fire`, `spell_power:critical_chance`)\n\n(All status effects come with fancy icons 😍)\n\n### Enchantments:\n\n- Universal Spell Power (named: \"Spell Power\"), increasing all spell damage\n- School limited Spell Power (for example: \"Sunfire\", increasing arcane and fire damage) \n- Secondary attribute enchantments (for example: \"Spell Critical Chance\")\n- \"Magic Protection\" (totally symmetric to Projectile Protection, but for magic)\n\n(All enchantments are fully configurable, and come with descriptions)\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.\n","published":"2022-12-23T13:31:08.411187Z","updated":"2023-11-12T17:39:46.008123Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":203399,"followers":132,"categories":["library","magic"],"additional_categories":["adventure","game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["OZt33z9y","8JZtHM36","FOc76ayi","ZIFDdYy8","Wzpqt33L","bE2Cpn06","wBSzMSuf","QMJuz1zi","7SbZEqA5","tuww90Eu","o5zzsgPA","6ffjOgGW","71FZTu9s","e2ggpysz","3e4ctFvH","aSo9SZuM","lME8r1AD","4b3xYbpW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8ooWzSQP/eac53d793cb13193c3860d90c5e19e680fbc7cb5.png"},"version":{"id":"4b3xYbpW","project_id":"8ooWzSQP","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"0.9.19+1.20.1","version_number":"0.9.19+1.20.1-fabric","changelog":"# 0.9.19\n\n- Add partial mutex for spell enchantments and ranged weapon enchantments\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-12T17:39:46.854798Z","downloads":115103,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"87401919c1c3f53ec4ca40a3b31b764b5ee752af5b7e5215cf20d28cbd53fc92a4fcdb45be4dfbc0f7b472f4835728def4b6e66452cc87752a9b727faa9d33f1","sha1":"dc8753e7a5bf0d6424f16d0c83ea1bd61f9c82b3"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8ooWzSQP/versions/4b3xYbpW/spell_power-fabric-0.9.19%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"spell_power-fabric-0.9.19+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":169590,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X228bzUD","user":{"id":"CUHgJfv9","username":"ZsoltMolnarrr","name":"Molnár Zsolt","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4989469?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-04T18:48:27.207892Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"spell_power-fabric-0.9.19+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\tectonic-mod-1.19.3-v2.2.jar":{"sha512":"805419ef899c856509d29bdefcdf40adaceec3aacc5bc6b95b879d28233f95f2b7a0fac828e088dd0fe2e97a14eb94709268fd0d1968d4679bdbcfc7e6c304d1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lWDHr9jE","slug":"tectonic","project_type":"mod","team":"ka5u9Zv5","title":"Tectonic","description":"Massively altered world generation with mountain ranges, underground rivers and more!","body":"![Tectonic logo](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/810083a46d3e071419e4fb7d28a126223838d7f1.png)\n\n![server, only](https://img.shields.io/badge/environment-server%20only-e61a1a)\n![datapack and mod](https://img.shields.io/badge/project%20type-datapack%20&%20mod-39951d)\n![all modloaders](https://img.shields.io/badge/modloader-all-eeeeee)\n\n**Tectonic** is a world generation datapack and mod that aims to transform how terrain is shaped.\n\n## Features\n\n### Mountain Ranges\n\nThe way mountains generate has been completely overhauled, with them forming huge mountain ranges that can stretch for thousands of blocks. These can stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, sometimes reaching peaks above y300!\n\n### Underground Rivers\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.  Very deep underground, you can even find a deeper variant with lava instead of water.\n\n### Oceanside Cliffs\n\nOn steep cliff faces in the Stony Shore biome, waves and wind carve into the cliff. (Disclaimer: waves and wind not included.)\n\n### Smoother Surfaces\n\nOne of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal. This means the strange staircasing on some hills - also referred to as \"lerp\" issues - is gone. In previous Tectonic versions this meant that Windswept biomes were removed from generation, but in v2 and above they will once again generate.\n\n### Dunes\n\nSmooth desert dunes will generate in some Desert biomes, giving Deserts a special look to them.\n\n### Deeper Oceans\n\nOceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer!\n\n-----\n\n### Removed Features\n\nPrevious versions of Tectonic included things like custom biomes, trees, and more. These were removed for both performance and compatibility reasons. For improved biome vegetation, check out [Not Just Biomes](https://modrinth.com/mod/not-just-biomes).\n","published":"2022-10-06T04:20:33.396078Z","updated":"2024-01-13T10:57:27.489603Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":331159,"followers":1502,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w03a","23w04a","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["eU3jwc8i","etznjsos","FwjITjTl","hnsJhfYa","5GAlwGt0","VrJPesuB","E5XyYJFU","PXOM0Pjv","WHCoQSwq","tv7QYqaD","YpYTfu5q","b9YiEZG5","hexdXndT","LfqeFzal","Sk2Wj54u","jEweyNSr","8DvETEcQ","kyOyZ959","CrJgVhRz","4FmsVRER","o79iZuLn","nCfuFGUJ","kD3ERzAU","YQW6UEha","iXsm0qYv","Xp7KZG02","31L9TtHa","IKoGJPng","VUDM6p8V","ikU2p37z","E1Z5e43T","T8MN0KIq","kBneO6ki","q8U9JFXx","5xZAjOFp","RffiLNDg","sJqpHn8g","iUOBzhHD","VUseyTDe","TROmHrN8","zTGbIDfc","NqBsgux4","9tb4XPoV","xH89dtCn","tx6rLdUA","xmaHuY49","5TxvYf3R","N2QHzPke","65V8fhDb","mBxJOCQy","yqPldUFz","1yngXVi8","9Vv7T6db","RGkQIH1q","rnuM9oqV","xLL0P4rp","VLm89jvQ","gO9d3ZPd","VpCClpZj","jNMP7968","TO90bMp9","gY8cl3L6","y3NXGAQL","8Efuao80","Ojy7D0Vt","xGrrU4rl","H2lfq68F","aZXeWJ3r","clI4wc2M","ZiVAiJjF","i48vQzPC","DRRt4Y5n","ynecO9fz","IFpAp5hn","jQaYKWuK","LhqG2XwP","KnptosY0","FSoTAxFx","wrLFLHwA","r4G2J8jv","v8KY2Bab","MDe9rNGW","IbkUCeqE","auHmdzit"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/9459286c7225ed66c57201881c12e8d1bb8fd2ce.png"},"version":{"id":"MDe9rNGW","project_id":"lWDHr9jE","author_id":"MllXIwZc","featured":false,"name":"v2.2 ~ 1.19.3-1.20.1","version_number":"2.2","changelog":"Massively improved mountain generation to be less spiky and more like proper mountains, thanks to [HB Stratos]([https://github.com/HB-Stratos/](https://github.com/HB-Stratos/))!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-13T08:43:10.504640Z","downloads":51532,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"805419ef899c856509d29bdefcdf40adaceec3aacc5bc6b95b879d28233f95f2b7a0fac828e088dd0fe2e97a14eb94709268fd0d1968d4679bdbcfc7e6c304d1","sha1":"02071212d273a62841506c019fd6b86469e8a67b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/versions/MDe9rNGW/tectonic-mod-1.19.3-v2.2.jar","filename":"tectonic-mod-1.19.3-v2.2.jar","primary":true,"size":249492,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ka5u9Zv5","user":{"id":"MllXIwZc","username":"Apollo","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102649729?v=4","bio":"I'm a solo datapack and mod developer, with a focus on world generation.

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen.

You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets. Your current set can be quickly switched with a key binding. <strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sharing</strong>. You can share your waypoints in the game chat with players on the server. This is done from the waypoints list (press U).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Deathpoints</strong>. An&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">automatic skull-shaped waypoint</strong>&nbsp;is created&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">on each death</strong>. Old deathpoints are converted to regular waypoints, which you can disable using the \"Keep Old Deathpoints\" setting.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod.</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">chunk grid</strong>. The chunk grid shows you where block chunks begin and end.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Togglable&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">slime chunks</strong>&nbsp;mode. The chunks where slimes can spawn are marked with a green overlay.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom light overlay</strong>. You can setup a light overlay that will mark blocks with a custom color if they are within a custom light value range, which is block light from 0 to 7 by default. The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\". You can do it through the <em>Waypoints Menu (press U) -&gt; Options</em> screen.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mobs</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">yellow dots.</strong>&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Hostile and friendly</strong>&nbsp;mobs can be colored&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">differently. </strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">players</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">white dots or player heads.&nbsp;</strong>Can also be displayed as <strong>icons/heads</strong>.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">items</strong>&nbsp;on the map as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">red dots. </strong>Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Displays all the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">other entities</strong>&nbsp;such as arrows and item frames as&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">purple dots</strong><span class=\"bbc\">.</span><strong class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;</strong>Different types of entities can be disabled in the settings.&nbsp;Check the <strong>\"Entity Radar\"</strong> settings.</li>\n<li>Options for <strong>displaying entity names </strong>on the minimap<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the \"Entity Radar\" settings.</li>\n<li>Zoom in and out key bindings&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">(I and O by default) </strong>to efficiently change the zoom level to fit your preference or use case.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Coordinates&nbsp;</strong>under the minimap.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Current biome name</strong>&nbsp;under the minimap.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

Now [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) is needed for an ingame configuration screen, but the mod will work fine without.**\n\n## Features\n* Hide the crosshair when not looking at anything.\n* Hide or show it depending on what is being looked at.\n* Hide or show it depending on the currently equipped item.\n* Change the crosshair style for various situations.\n* Highly configurable.\n\n\n## Dependencies\nThis mod has been written for Minecraft >= 1.18.2.\n\n### Fabric version\n* requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n* versions up to 5.5 require [ClothConfig](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)\n* from version 6 upwards, there is an optional dependency on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) for the ingame configuration

screen\n\n## Mod Compatibility\nThis mod is very strongly coupled to vanilla Minecraft and has to hardcode a lot of interaction rules.\nThus, playing on a non-vanilla world will make the advanced features (context-dependent style) unreliable.\n\nIf you play with content mods, I recommend also installing [Dynamic Crosshair Compat](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamiccrosshaircompat).\n\nIf you like dynamic UI elements, also check out my other mod [Auto HUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/autohud) that extends dynamic behaviour to most of the HUD.\n\nDynamicCrosshair is currently not compatible with [Exordium](https://modrinth.com/mod/exordium) (set its `enabledGui` setting to false to use its other features).","published":"2022-05-15T15:58:15.616504Z","updated":"2024-02-16T13:30:48.020616Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":710140,"followers":747,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["20bC160n","zJdREVIO","IXij3556","GkGeCML8","Jx2bA8fW","wX0EkxBG","UIPy4N6Y","u6oZjWMI","fwgB6xzq","rbuG9j4d","42x8E1l2","I3ozSAMN","UsI5wvVJ","Ex7R0pvH","bevKbyCT","C9PPMB8n","PUz7ZA69","DnIkKSEu","pKw86PFV","L1X78OCz","piwY5EqP","KdZ4nnQf","KCnkG2JM","vOx5xdxw","8cW3fCjp","OojuYcAm","SoTS6lF5","JZoNSBuy","N8iKshJP","vOMoMaOE","dSEqWeht","6x22u0T1","N3ze65Pu","8npnkOAY","JCXboA43","GwfJ6OPL","Q5W9seuT","MDMciNGY","DOxF1Usr","kVzqYdl5","hBz2RX9S","mqjafYwh","4XF7aDYQ","PDcGuAk3","dB2WXccw","oE6ADLJm","kBkiCSXP","KdRiHgim","Ngbs1lmT","p8mFGtnA","aT7BTmm2","7pIz7Bqe","5Rbzl2ai","HQNnNcTz","rzl6699L","b1MI0lNn","XXp55Fwj","aDXQGAnW","7LySfCZd","jwMWMQBh","3Rj2xiej","UrGLoyuO","jdd7O6I5","3BXMBlz0","Bgo2WQoz","4yNSnLVO","1HKz8pDD","cdWvTN6A","zma0Z88N","EJvo2aYT","SnHjacoX","L3cqS0s1","XxwoXEjt","uuUU7D4O","oGBybcWG","ha2GrJES","qSS7rxZG","kEvLJuWh","nhu2REPZ","AVTfWKih","kgZyjYD0","25UaxOtl","Q7LLoEz8","m758kre1","VlilX4g3","NpJSZyut","KLOwuZTc","siGvzEkG","pnStFlrz","zT12VILM","cR2jSKNv","S5sH62fG","UwrH9Wmp","PYMFga4Y","5ABRCqrl","svCwRMnR","wlHubjbx","me9sUGWp","GaDrUzLS","H2k9LvrK","B8uyNMAs","dHnDtwk3","AF6KCHFM","hW7fVOwD","xMsvqe7U","rOBAdNim","kV3gDaO6","Afi523uo","n7vNnWWX","hUj6v5bw","4ZNImu1V","7POTmnEb","HEyECMZD","BfvDyEpZ","B3fvmlGz","N4UrisV7","d5kHzOKy","ONH6Kqie","YZEVRL4i","J6uJYksd","h3YFJv7Z","ggoGe2EL","d1DZkc4J","1A4txeh8","lJhn7D9r","PlUmODOj","OvVeBAYa","RqouYFCA","yl7hdLYl","SgFUFMUD","iKnz6GmD","8x7iVA0A","DLtLuMzW","Vk1E4s8i","P70fS7oo","I1X42LQO","GxY44U4X","vW2z45Qw","gTjxflCI","8TADH0x4","nqnapHoW","4Oy7MCbK","j6JI3Ye5","AKd5ifeI","yI2M7Yw8","plDJhPkU","TBUQvVSc","wrKCukUs","ob3ideD4","1Cz6IyIk","z2n9Rh5O","83ZByaiI","vNnu7BoP","9TBX0qkD","U4QPyiFl","MneD8ExX","rp8sdu78","eCPSnqOy","eRIHItNH","6W6aaYaB","qumfSFz3","UrOG4IKT","PhOrxa0w","c7j11R0M"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZcR9weSm/8da8af58ca961f937bd05d41dcefa26be7b5c182.png"},"version":{"id":"9TBX0qkD","project_id":"ZcR9weSm","author_id":"bQuYYbeE","featured":false,"name":"[Fabric

HUD","description":"A mod which dynamically hides parts of the user interface","body":"\nAuto HUD is a Minecraft mod which hides parts of the user\ninterface (HUD) that are currently not interesting.\n\nIt is inspired by similar mods (\"immersive hud\") for other games.\nI personally really like the clean view of no visible HUD, but get frustrated by the\nlimitations of using F1 mode.\n\nThis is an opinionated rewrite of [Head-down Display](https://github.com/jadc/headdowndisplay/) that never got updated.\n\n**NOTE: From version 4 on, Cloth-Config has been dropped. Now [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) is needed for an ingame configuration screen, but the mod will work fine without.**\n\n## Features\n* Toggle the whole HUD with a key binding.\n* Have parts of the HUD that haven't changed hide away.\n* Hide persistent, unchanging status effects, such as water breathing from the turtle helmet.\n* Show remaining time of status effects.\n* Highly configurable.\n\n### Visual differences to F1 mode\n* Player hand / equipped items remain visible\n* Player names remain visible\n* The vignette remains active\n* Incoming chat messages still pop up\n* Crosshair remains visible (see my other mod Dynamic Crosshair for that)\n* Configurable what elements are hidden\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* Optional dependency on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) for ingame configuration screen\n\n### Fabric only\n* requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n* optional: [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) for ingame configuration screen\n\n## Mod Compatibility\nThis mod includes a modified version of magicus' [Status Effect Timers](https://modrinth.com/mod/statuseffecttimer),\nbecause I could not figure out how to dynamically insert my modifications into it.\nSince this mod allows for status effect icons to be hidden individually,\nthe non-modified version will draw the timers in the wrong place.\n\nKnown to be compatible:\n* [Dynamic Crosshair](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamiccrosshair) augments this mod by dynamically hiding the crosshair as well.\n* [Raised](https://modrinth.com/mod/raised) works perfectly.\n* [HUDTweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/hudtweaks) mostly works.\n  Vertical status effects bar does not work with the timer overlay.\n  Animation direction and offset may have to be tweaked in AutoHud's settings manually.\n* [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin) appears to work fine.\n* [DetailArmorBar](https://modrinth.com/mod/detail-armor-bar) is supported.\n* [BerdinskiyBear's Armor Hud](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/berdinskiybears-armor-hud) is supported in hotbar mode.\n\nKnown to be incompatible:\n* OptiFabric crashes due to mixin conflicts.\n* Any other mod that draws status effect timers should have that functionality disabled.\n* HUD elements created by other mods will most likely not be moved.\n* Bedrockify overwrites the status effect modifications. To get them working, disable the `screenSafeArea` mixin.\n* Running AutoHUD together with Exordium can cause visual issues\n","published":"2022-05-15T15:50:20.749352Z","updated":"2024-01-13T18:50:38.042065Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":50253,"followers":381,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["RvyadWAV","a3pHKWTX","AyOnl4Jh","dmClI76y","Qv91LkAR","DYkKed6T","AwUELPe4","gAxCfHlD","GoEiORJB","bu9pHeGc","KrOD2Aui","HIVb6Oon","d61bDuF0","GuNROkc3","leGhLwNO","gg8yDhWA","LC9RNrO7","8WOdEzK6","zTuQLyEl","lLlp71PI","9hkuLTj0","gseAIZ7u","qS2GQgVk","qEWpUaOD","M0EtcTxa","R2knSP1S","Kf6HHhAt","G4HByt5W","aJ055eLf","vmvZvy8I","BOYnLpHO","Wh2LV1ge","3wFa8YaY","JHsN5Roa","8chOrCT6","x54fp8G8","TyP9drU7","1ZeOZDX2","fxT885N5","UdOSHnLF","reoNwDVa","HA6IGW4x","ljaWlVnm","sOyMYLH5","E4NrmrgJ","5kaRBTkJ","TwRwJ0OH","4EKigYHT","DpuFiAei","SlKgUH2p","MnW3SMZG","dnvF9to0","EGmh8rjR","IXk3IFsq","I8Elvcmo","kE6Zmve6","Ihi0Xf86","u08m9EPu","RdJKUbal","Zi51qlMs","nDpI0hXp","UkWMZyQX","kCfTnRUl","zXP5A92C","Tkxkvq4z","ZLIBmTqT","4fvepZ9t","typ9u2OO","DTYhuNKx","JBeJMHTm","pyZnHkju","c0wouvtm","XQE01yYQ","ySSVsmvP","1prjGrKR","m1ldNZ82","ZxtFysns","IJPIWcT3","BOMzBD9B","l5Z1K4H0","Pfa1PFdF","t3h2GnqQ","R90QkfkN","BCEOcOsl","gIQSoRbC","BYHE4afx","icYXF5W4","sEDA9iGr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/temczoTQ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"BYHE4afx","project_id":"temczoTQ","author_id":"bQuYYbeE","featured":false,"name":"[Fabric 1.20.1] Auto HUD 6.3.3","version_number":"6.3.3+1.20.1-fabric","changelog":"Re-release with bumped version number","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-30T11:19:17.024828Z","downloads":3723,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6667f7ac463e54bd406a8a7782cacd9ba1b92dead347699336f7d72b6c1aeb34fd5af4d03aed480099901d5cbbc4ad1a65e21cf6473b0b6f683df84d7da87b43","sha1":"1895d4a73c745aaf51aa372b6d4f53213e8f1386"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/temczoTQ/versions/BYHE4afx/autohud-6.3.3%2B1.20.1-fabric.jar","filename":"autohud-6.3.3+1.20.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":578820,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"NAittMUY","user":{"id":"bQuYYbeE","username":"Crendgrim","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/bQuYYbeE/icon.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-15T15:11:17.484419Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"autohud-6.3.3+1.20.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\moreculling-1.20.4-0.22.1.jar":{"sha512":"c562f4319c6aa13b84bb92ee63074792648af2a3d8711a2b49e865e25b2690cd26ad7b272d59dc228bb39315c035a32792755fb896d3d939ef23533fb80cbde5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"51shyZVL","slug":"moreculling","project_type":"mod","team":"lt2h1d9p","title":"More Culling","description":"A mod that changes how multiple types of culling are handled in order to improve performance","body":"# More Culling  \n### A mod that changes how multiple types of culling are handled in order to improve performance\nCulling is when you don't render things that the player can't see, to improve performance\n\nRequires Cloth Config!\n  \n**Make sure to report any bugs [here](https://github.com/fxmorin/moreculling/issues)!** \n\n**Discord Server:** [https://discord.gg/SGFDrvA](https://discord.gg/SGFDrvA)  \n  \n**Head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/fxmorin/MoreCulling/wiki) for information on:**   \nWhat's Culled, Performance, Compatibility, Bug Fixes, and more!

improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you.

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n","published":"2021-06-08T00:05:32.472592Z","updated":"2023-09-21T23:28:53.528734Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":639146,"followers":872,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["70Ajg5iP","dRgbv7A2","29Jd2Dm4","qpiOPBB9","R2UW6ejS","FdJA5sbK","DtvgyMK2","vOuy3Z5S","XqLNMi9J","WiXqMygm","oLUBJhyv","9qrmAiwv","OLwsMJv4","5zEAvqnX","A5kxdEY3","z8ProfKL","e563ycts","tJ23Vcff"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"e563ycts","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.7.1","version_number":"3.7.1","changelog":"### Additions\n* Added zh_cn language support\n\n### Fixes\n* Properly expose CCA dependencies for new Loom versions\n* Target the new CCA Maven","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-22T01:20:47.934095Z","downloads":377324,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e2869ce20fc87025a8a7d2cbca58ff4857f287004141f51e4b297ea240c18950d5c0ddff258547731974a763efd835d8c3c283804dae03a42e31cb761800f75d","sha1":"eb2a91a80d18513ca0b9ea3f76fc86422166e440"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/e563ycts/trinkets-3.7.1.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.7.1.jar","primary":true,"size":234448,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F0xlmrbH","user":{"id":"R6WsWKy9","username":"Emi","name":"Emi","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14813658?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-26T21:52:52.726926Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"trinkets-3.7.1.jar"},"mods\\Cobblemon-fabric-1.4.1+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"6955c8ad187d727cbfc51761312258600c5480878983cfe710623070c90eb437e419c140ff3c77e5066164876ecfe1e31b87f58f5ef175f0758efcff246b85a8","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"MdwFAVRL","slug":"cobblemon","project_type":"mod","team":"tbD5PVl4","title":"Cobblemon","description":"A Pokémon mod for Fabric and Forge","body":"<p><center><a title=\"https://cobblemon.com\" href=\"https://cobblemon.com\"><img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/971302699318542357/1081160106156236881/Frame_9banner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"197\" /></a></center></p>\n<p><center><span><font size=\"5\">Cobblemon is an open-source Pok&eacute;mon mod for Fabric and Forge.</font></span></center></p>\n<p><span>The goal of&nbsp;Cobblemon&nbsp;is to be the Pok&eacute;mon mod for everyone, and to integrate much better into modpacks and Minecraft itself than other Pok&eacute;mon mods.

Dust","description":"Dust is a Minecraft mod that adds the white ash particle from the Basalt Deltas biome to the underground to simulate dust!","body":"## What...what is \"Cave Dust\"?\nI'm glad you asked! It's just a mod that adds the white ash particle from the Basalt Deltas biome to the underground to simulate dust! After all, the air wouldn't be 100% clear in a real mineshaft :p\n\nNow to the nitty gritty: It works by checking if the player has the sky above them while being below sea level and then scales the amount of particles based on depth.\n\nIt has a config system that you can access using Mod Menu, most things you can change in-game, but to change the particle you'll need to open the config file manually :)\nAs a note, it doesn't activate in the Lush Caves biome, since it already has it's own particles :p\n\nThis was inspired by Dylanstime in the [moonflower Discord server](​https://www.moonflower.gg/discord), thanks for the idea!\n![Screenshot of Discord message from Dylanstime, reading: \"is it possible to copy the code for the dust in the basalt deltas and put them in caves but smaller amounts and slower\nor maybe a mod that adds effects similar to it in other biomes\"](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/443/991/image_2022-03-26_163011.png)\n \n\n# Dependencies\nCave Dust requires the Fabric API but everything else Cave Dust needs is included. HOWEVER, I recommend Mod Menu to be able to use the config screen :p\n\n# Showcase video\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VO_Ye_GxLo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","published":"2022-03-20T16:38:39.424094Z","updated":"2024-02-13T18:02:34.617730Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":533741,"followers":519,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["Py33tow5","gahMQvsI","34OgoMtl","FDJHe9g8","MVXqs9F9","nDn2y1u1","TNR8Lud5","QklS2lL8","uwRJ0rve","TW6c5l4O","fXpkDYlu","A7S98Yta","THAZLE71","Q4XjAOms","xLrEbZc7","a9UUmKO4","xi7z8Usp","K2RWzMqf","inDklMG3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jawg7zT1/2e6beb501657efee1b3c42d11541656912abad32.png"},"version":{"id":"TW6c5l4O","project_id":"jawg7zT1","author_id":"SNP113OB","featured":true,"name":"v1.4.1 1.20.1","version_number":"1.4.1","changelog":"Updated to 1.20.0 and 1.20.1!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-21T01:43:26.044506Z","downloads":350078,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"08cf3dda0dafa14f00ba32a062c15739cf6bc014","sha512":"6df9aaa675f1c8d7d179c0f50dde9e06a12996c17f2d9173cd367d49099faa850caedd2ee55e48487febd78bd460d97541733a825e9cf6489f1d224ca82fb0dc"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jawg7zT1/versions/TW6c5l4O/cave_dust-1.4.1.jar","filename":"cave_dust-1.4.1.jar","primary":true,"size":239387,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ivI5m61F","user":{"id":"SNP113OB","username":"LizIsTired","name":"Liz Graham","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13466206?v=4","bio":"Game design student at Solent University.

[Discord](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n## What if I want to enable some bug fixes, but not others?\nDebugify has a configuration GUI accessible by Fabric's [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).\nIf you don't want to it, there is always the configuration file located at\n`.minecraft/config/debugify.json`\n\n![configuration menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/191992486-4ba9bd8f-db37-4021-b302-7f54701d8b08.png)\n\n## Client, or Server?\nDebugify includes many fixes for both the client and server (all server fixes also apply to client).\nSo you should definitely use it on both.\n\n## Can I include this in my modpack?\nYes! Of course! I even added a little feature in the mod for you! The constant updates may be exhausting to maintain,\nso I added a config option that defaults new bug fixes to off, until you get round to looking at it.\n\n## Credits\n- [**isXander**](https://github.com/isXander) - Founder of project\n- [**Contributors**](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/graphs/contributors) - For PRing new fixes!\n- [**MoonTidez**](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Creating an awesome logo!\n\n### Translators\n- [**RaptaG**](https://github.com/RaptaG) - Greek\n- [**Altegar**](https://github.com/Altegar) - Ukrainian\n- [**ttrafford7**](https://github.com/ttrafford7) - Ukrainian\n- [**GodGun968**](https://github.com/GodGun968) - Chinese\n- [**Agentew04**](https://github.com/Agentew04) - Portuguese\n- [**localfossa**](https://github.com/localfossa) - Turkish\n- [**xMikux**](https://github.com/xMikux) - Traditional Chinese\n","published":"2022-03-17T20:44:31.607662Z","updated":"2023-12-23T10:11:45.639943Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1223146,"followers":1482,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["d1wGDnOg","rvmKzdit","lFcWshUo","nDA4zR8b","bDJ6C3ee","YToHBCxz","SL7w72eH","phRoW4cz","XcwsnmsZ","1pnb6cGl","fX9fSRpc","D3InZWhh","NR1MuP9t","ez77o4vP","ZSOeDjPU","rlPcRBXm","nElg9xeo","J3zRK5bi","FatqexKs","tWRyPcFL","NDu88Zwa","hY3DKYio","aOxCEP3D","CSWmF24f","pPFCiLjA","BCj6Z3cx","TCs1cNbH","7WXEKPNx","Tk0RAQMD","rKzPCLMb","jlIRKhk7","m21FBC92","XtJaW95T","ltSWiXrH","jxiMbq1j","GeIPOMAw","IWgfkuO9","vgor1UDw","h7UENtbi","BmkonV8u","LVTec1Rh","US297WEJ","7nWg7CpV","2CSuLT5g","4J87zok9","11cqAA0W","1Wc2PZ7G","IhcW4hp4","jl2bfULg","qGM9M0wh","9xvnFOIg","KB2xqwsT","W2UIVXCp","SCJtEeya","HdzIkYvh","pYAlD9TK","UvBWAMZL","l8A2i9nV","fgjgGIfI","GtD9tAHh","v2s5aT84","CQP9o8LS","oevI3RPR","jskCDMsk","l6S5WIlU","7SaNcvDx","6ckEWNPu","GTuKuQLA","6XDJoCks","ZSI78Xd3","pfPFUzJF","vJOKWGcy","gGTvKKDk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QwxR6Gcd/d1db8e74a5ad29908bd011ce271145cea349cd13.png"},"version":{"id":"6XDJoCks","project_id":"QwxR6Gcd","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"1.20.1+2.0 (1.20.1)","version_number":"1.20.1+2.0","changelog":"[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n\n# Debugify 1.20.1+2.0\n\n## New Fixes\n\n- [MC-263865](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-263865) - Fullscreen state isn't saved when F11 is pressed\n- *by [Ampflower](https://github.com/isXander/Debugify/pull/259),* [MC-8187](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-8187) - Two-by-two arrangements of jungle or spruce saplings cannot grow when there are adjacent blocks located north or west of the sapling formation\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-09T08:49:42.583816Z","downloads":533223,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"4cbeeafd7daadcf8a54526b6f415eac39c8bd1459d44967f484c499f407b9625c10faa5c8f825946d97529d5d64fd7504669bc13ebc4c3eb2a143aa20b50e4bd","sha1":"ca859180ad2b57856fbcc8db4995c1871a7d556c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QwxR6Gcd/versions/6XDJoCks/Debugify-1.20.1%2B2.0.jar","filename":"Debugify-1.20.1+2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":337545,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"CgwTUAR2","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"eTCL1uh8","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ArPsDJdJ","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Debugify-1.20.1+2.0.jar"},"mods\\AmbientSounds_FABRIC_v5.3.9_mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"032e998df872f35f4789199714dcc0360c48125745b8df1356e84b9a3e10f68b7fbdbb5a10703950f18c7ec5620d25996c256387f671c7ffcb57ce8b7c96b5eb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fM515JnW","slug":"ambientsounds","project_type":"mod","team":"4RhBAs8B","title":"AmbientSounds","description":"#listentonature","body":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Z1QIyxFUas\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n**Requires [CreativeCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/creativecore)**\n\nAdds a rich ambience to the minecraft world.

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name. Simply shift + right-click a name tag to <strong>Open A Simple Interface</strong> for setting a new name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Text Can Be Stylized</strong> using Minecraft's native formatting codes in both the anvil and name tag interface. This allows for setting custom colors and styles when choosing item and entity names. Check the <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Usage\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Minecraft Wiki</strong></span></a> for more information on formatting codes.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/27/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/28/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Anvils can be so fancy!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Free name tag renames</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/29/2022-09-29_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/30/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>No max level limit anymore</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>No anvil required for renaming name tags anymore</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/422/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/424/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Repair anvils by one stage using iron blocks</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use formatting codes when naming your equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want enchanting tables to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Magic</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Forge on versions of Minecraft before 1.17?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Check out the mods which inspired this project: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Tweaks</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-repair\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Repair</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nametags-without-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nametags Without Anvils</span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/tfarecnim\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>tfarecnim</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for

Lib","description":"dynamic data pack and registration, villager activities, custom map marker and a lot more","body":"Features of this library are:\n\n- Dynamic resource pack utilities\nA set of utilities that allow creating dynamic runtime resource packs and datapacks. Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement

game logic/server optimization mod","body":"Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. \n\n<br>\n\nThe mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)\n\n<br>\n\nFor multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2023-12-20T22:19:09.571967Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3677408,"followers":8447,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.11.2","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.11.2","changelog":"Lithium 0.11.2 for Minecraft 1.20.1 is the same as the previous release, just for 1.20.1 instead of 1.20.\n\nYou can check out all configuration options [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/blob/mc1.20.1-0.11.2/lithium-mixin-config.md).\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-12T23:58:59.682048Z","downloads":1428585,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d1b5c90ba8b4879814df7fbf6e67412febbb2870e8131858c211130e9b5546e86b213b768b912fc7a2efa37831ad91caf28d6d71ba972274618ffd59937e5d0d","sha1":"8f4642147e60827f728badac7a819d1a9f3b25d5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/versions/ZSNsJrPI/lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","filename":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":645865,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"uhPSqlnd","username":"2No2Name","name":"2No2Name","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T09:13:58.517719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1363084?v=4","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar"},"mods\\reeses_sodium_options-1.7.2+mc1.20.1-build.101.jar":{"sha512":"efb5eab3caea346f9d13ea7c73e856f286bba1c87508c7250deada7bf4e9ad179a12e9861f61145d5c9578d88f740abf19c564f14579aac5da1f46bf6f086977","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Bh37bMuy","slug":"reeses-sodium-options","project_type":"mod","team":"MlZUm0f7","title":"Reese's Sodium Options","description":"Alternative Options Menu for Sodium","body":"Replaces Sodium's Options Screen with intention of improving UX\n\n \n\n# Features\n- Search Bar.\n- Slider values can be changed while holding down `SHIFT` key and scrolling.\n- Scrollable Tabs\n- Scrollable Pages (Overall better UX when using with Sodium Extra).\n- Iris Shader Pack Button.\n \n\n# Screenshot\n\n![image](https://i.imgur.com/KBsXRBI.png)\n\n![image2](https://i.imgur.com/UjVSMcC.png)\n\n\n# Requirements\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)\n\n\n#### Please do not go and ask CaffeineMC to support this.

Slicer\n\nThis mod enables a variety of features to create better compatibility between mostly [Farmer's Delight][FARMERS_DELIGHT_FORGE] and [Create][CREATE_FORGE].\nWhile it is designed to work with Farmer's Delight, it does work without it and also adds some compatibility features for other mods.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/slicer.png)\n\n### Automatic Cutting\n\nThe Main feature of the mod is the _Slicer_, a machine similar to the _Mechanical Mixer_ or _Mechanical Press_ from Create.\nIt automatically registers all cutting recipes from Farmer's Delight. In that sense, it is an automatic _Cutting Board_.  \nIn order to use it, the correct tool has to be placed into the machine, using `Right-Click`.\nBy default, only knives and axes are allowed, but this behaviour can be overwritten by modifying the `sliceanddice:allowed_tools` item tag.\nAn example datapack which adds shears to this tag can be found [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/raw/1.20.x/example_datapack.zip)\n\n### Automatic Cooking\n\nAll recipes from Farmer's delight requiring the Cooking Pot are added as heated mixing recipes.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/cooking.png)\n\n### Sprinkler\n\nThe Sprinkler is a block which, when provided with a fluid using a pipe, will distribute it in a small area below.  \nDifferent fluids can have different effects.\n\n- Lava applies a small amount of fire damage to entities below\n- Water makes the area below wet, making the world think it's raining there.\n- Potions apply their affect for a short duration to entities below\n- Liquid Fertilizer, a new fluid, applies a bonemeal affect to blocks.\n\nThe latter is meant to enable growing of _Banana Fonds_ from [Neapolitan][NEAPOLITAN] without being dependent on the weather, but it could possibly have other effects on other mods too.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/sprinkler.png)\n\n### Overweight Farming\n\nIf present, some compatibility features for [Overweight Farming][OVERWEIGHT_FARMING] is added.  \nThis includes waxing recipes using the deployer,\nas well as showing the axe-stripping of overweight crops in JEI.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/strip.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/wax.png)\n","published":"2022-08-14T17:09:40.957018Z","updated":"2023-09-22T07:59:41.249837Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":247676,"followers":279,"categories":["food","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["UJTc0pk2","1wP6CNfI","Nk2dO6Go","KriL1JFW","r4yDHtFN","tA385l8n","JH33REuT","tZZRCOac","lXNFlrvW","OIhe0uO4","ZmhTpjLR","pRwBOCJc","gCGCFJis","hPDyRNw3","lrslRK8c","fGG0Gjcv","mG1fIOia","akAH2F1g","89gCgL8n","FF8UA0pu","LfIs9gRN","PmCarZvQ","BZLiJ13y","O8bSqUaV","sGqyWl93","U9GIWHMX","uv6f7FCw","t8iOd0XR","7HTroPJk","kvrLbSxC","1aTrUinS","qWFV16cD","3wyhfJQQ","vd7c2RPJ","mTr2nUPj","t3lFXxzY","aRK21L9m","qaNqtys9","nkNOsYBR","rYnuEPwn","tAgVGTaW","s9l4uqVE","IlpHtI0z","ZEitGVtL","73nfCddX","etRuKHcg","yZ9zZESN","giM4WleV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GmjmRQ0A/9af7f38727e4c1dc30c67fefd80b15000a2b8c07.png"},"version":{"id":"etRuKHcg","project_id":"GmjmRQ0A","author_id":"qxswSLtS","featured":false,"name":"Fabric 3.0.0","version_number":"3.0.0","changelog":"- initial port to 1.20.x","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-06T14:28:15.841769Z","downloads":122485,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"54986a4c776e89a7de24334ec982fca88bae38612b7dec59073dbb6bbdfed3ab116bfb2fccd5ccfb838dd067a9fc257567b85745a1dcb5ba81c7e7ac9c0260a8","sha1":"28fca89ff480a636029cf3effa26963a3ea3af6e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GmjmRQ0A/versions/etRuKHcg/sliceanddice-fabric-3.0.0.jar","filename":"sliceanddice-fabric-3.0.0.jar","primary":true,"size":556690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"4EakbH8e","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Xbc0uyRg","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"l7tsXKAD","user":{"id":"qxswSLtS","username":"possible_triangle","name":"Possible Triangle","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12880806?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-06-13T20:35:57.654377Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sliceanddice-fabric-3.0.0.jar"},"datapacks\\Repurposed_Structures-Better_Jungle_Temples_v6.zip":{"sha512":"cdd6811d14e9ca2af162013a09d1764d0be48008f4b150371c8e5edc0845131441d0a78d043c6989064d9101c495663e624bb379b1cf160c4860bcd793e9f5b0","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gAvG8ZeC","slug":"repurposed-structures-better-jungle-temples","project_type":"mod","team":"2bNztB7k","title":"Repurposed Structures - Better Jungle Temples Compat","description":"Change RS Temples to be in Better Jungle Temple's style","body":"Add this datapack to the game to add compatibility between Repurposed Structures and Yung's Better Jungle Temples.

**[Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)** is installed.\n\n# Continuity\n\nContinuity is a Fabric mod built around modern APIs to allow for the most efficient connected textures experience possible. It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n","published":"2021-09-25T20:27:10.714654Z","updated":"2023-10-02T18:16:52.181784Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1904769,"followers":4265,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Xn8QzMB9","6JEV45oM","i0ccQghD","27YRAXEt","SffGs8Ro","yiOF0F2t","sD3iTKbB","gOxkykhO","Bl7pOAQf","zcqSiVI3","jjpzIZoY","xTtULC68","YEKdScFW","Ql3Ho9eR","4h5IIa7B","ImUFj5Gl","G2qoxVmV","OOpbpU2z","xy2co4Rh","JYaO3lPe","Z9FJWLMt","JXhQlDZl"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Z9FJWLMt","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-02T18:16:30.272151Z","downloads":590979,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b662fd625ba1f06c6e4958eac373856047d0d2a9","sha512":"2a42ef76cd2a60af01fffed1cd9e08270b537f116f7fa0ede49a5b526fa7b9860845a6f321c4a7600f80e739391eb24a6e6d9850c33894b58bc2d01a8a63f8b4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/Z9FJWLMt/continuity-3.0.0-beta.4%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1050571,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uoI5LZgV","user":{"id":"CdcF3lqY","username":"PepperCode1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/CdcF3lqY/24a325b36c3ce10dbc1a86cc68c5eeb212784b63.png","bio":"","created":"2021-09-25T20:18:09.628691Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\firstperson-fabric-2.3.4-mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"bb56bf6e5915fbbcd579ec119e3c38f69f48a40277d93985f52233aa5c3e4ba16a783e700bbdd926b75a30dfe79b634519b1fd9bce6060376e0cba300bec7e8f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"H5XMjpHi","slug":"first-person-model","project_type":"mod","team":"R0i4rBZY","title":"First-person Model","description":"Enables the third-person Model in first-person","body":"![](https://trsha.re/1679269573.png)\n\n\n# First-person Model\n\nEnables the third-person Model in first-person, so you can experience Minecraft from Steve's real perspective.

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

This vector allows us to shift the start time for our rotation).\r\n- Added an experimental `multi-texture` skybox type ([wiki section](https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/blob/1.20.x/dev/docs/schema-v2.md#multi-texture-skybox)).\r\n- Added contributing guidelines and a code of conduct.\r\n- Allowed fog color modification to also modify fog density.\r\n- Added a configuration file (`.minecraft/config/fabricskyboxes-config.json`).\r\n    - Saves enable state.\r\n    - Added a `keepVanillaBehaviour` flag.\r\n- Fixed the URL issue when using Sinytra Connector (#96).\r\n- Fixed the alpha rendering for the end skybox type.\r\n- Added a debugging HUD (Keybind is unbound, meant for resource pack authors).\r\n- Added vi_vn translations (#94) by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/pull/94.\r\n- Improved performance for several skybox types.\r\n- Fixed cyclic fade alpha calculation.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/pull/94\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/compare/mc1.20.1-0.7.2...mc1.20.1-0.7.3","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-21T17:14:48.403898Z","downloads":283099,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"31a13b9ca0a500b4caad993ec42e1199142d86d1","sha512":"e71c12b81f10b42c06fac9719a2135c6d34f298fb12d926bce9aca6af8655b76ccb31dce9561543499a019e43e93cf4036dc051fe2a97ca2a8fe112f646a99a5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/YBz7DOs8/versions/cezLH6eB/fabricskyboxes-0.7.3%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"fabricskyboxes-0.7.3+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":207272,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"1be0c4dcf981029c21d6e6c641e55c0d575e234a7839140280f9dc5fe94219001865083d9f69372820bdd1a0e8b0510f9cc3477ae0480d66bda63962dbf6dd1a","sha1":"9dabd7fc37aedd8b48580dfed48ac32b9979ad7c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/YBz7DOs8/versions/cezLH6eB/fabricskyboxes-0.7.3%2Bmc1.20.1-sources.jar","filename":"fabricskyboxes-0.7.3+mc1.20.1-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":134460,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fXSWgsrG","user":{"id":"QXAY01zS","username":"FlashyReese","name":"FlashyReese","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30311066?v=4","bio":"Studying Software Engineer at UADY","created":"2020-10-23T09:28:46.803957Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"fXSWgsrG","user":{"id":"ifLBWnLs","username":"AMereBagatelle","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/56981737?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-11-07T23:20:09.669752Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fabricskyboxes-0.7.3+mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\midnightlib-fabric-1.4.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"2780de49e687343cee6577ec5d029571e214e427f999f5bd651d33b9aae190a19d832feb82ba67aa8779a614579379b982c021bad5e9a87a841e5e0276486078","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"codAaoxh","slug":"midnightlib","project_type":"mod","team":"ANsuWAaP","title":"MidnightLib","description":"Common library with a built-in configuration system","body":"<center>MidnightLib is a lightweight library that provides common utils and a configuration system for mods.</br>\n</br>Mod developers are allowed and encouraged to bundle it with their mods via Jar-in-Jar.<br />Every feature can be toggled in the library's own config screen/file.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/507982666755473427/1036592375310590022/Screenshot_Minecraft_1.19.2_3.png?width=774&height=644\" alt=\"Example configuration screen\" height=\"532\" />\n<center>Visit the new <a href=\"https://www.midnightdust.eu/wiki/midnightlib\">Wiki</a> to get started now.</center>","published":"2021-06-01T14:51:21.610099Z","updated":"2023-12-24T11:58:03.368293Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":787945,"followers":531,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17-pre1","1.17-pre2","1.17-pre3","1.17-pre4","1.17-pre5","1.17-rc1","1.17-rc2","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","21w37a","21w38a","21w39a","21w40a","21w41a","21w42a","21w43a","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre2","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19-pre1","1.19-rc1","1.19-rc2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","22w43a","1.19.3","23w06a","1.19.4-rc1","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["hKWL2zcT","Kw04mA42","N0JbZODl","9YFt1G6x","ezOz5VpH","uDW75m2s","DqtZHIIn","kU3LjFF9","4MyeoEWF","i8A5ABQm","enS8Fiz0","Ym6rLlMR","7kzsg4GY","IoDITtak","XU1FUSji","yGcnG06S","CRaHmCcJ","E9lkXHyn","s2fTj4LM","WjT0Llfm","EAWVPebu","p0LjncVW","r9djZ2iR","hxPiYWhh","61U935Ys","UmJ7FJgm","e50cGA1L","eFAHLL8n","DmWy11sa","Atr5M7ky","CQcP4Q8L","lalsp8PT","kJmuqGbh","WQMjF7Uk","3YykTkmJ","MsATpcA9","YXz8kIQl","Ozm1zl15","9JfOZ2yZ","ckM1ja0p","JlgGEOUe","HgbzM3Ki","EQNuBJf5","UhRAdyzr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/codAaoxh/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"YXz8kIQl","project_id":"codAaoxh","author_id":"6YsSV9eP","featured":true,"name":"MidnightLib 1.4.1 -

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style.

There are also 3\nother smaller optimisations, that increase biome population speed, chunk unlocking speed, and the speed of sampling blockstates for\ngeneration.  \nIn `NoiseChunkGenerator#populateNoise`, setting the blockstate via abstractions/built-in functions is bypassed. Instead, the blocks are set\ndirectly in the palette storage, thus bypassing a lot of calculations and things Minecraft does that are normally useful when blocks are\nset, but when generating the world only slow it down, this is a cycle optimisation.\n\nNoisium has full 1:1 parity with vanilla worldgen (worldgen without Noisium).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required\n\nNone.\n\n## Compatibility info\n\n### Compatible mods\n\nNoisium should be compatible with most, if not all, of the popular optimisation mods currently on Modrinth/CurseForge for\nMinecraft `1.20.x`, since Noisium aims to fill in the gaps in performance optimisation left by other mods.\nThis includes (but is not limited to) C2ME, Lithium, Nvidium, and Sodium.\n\n- Distant Horizons: Noisium speeds up LOD world generation threads, since LOD generation depends on Minecraft's world generation speed.\n\n### Incompatibilities\n\nNo known incompatibilities at this time.\n\n## Download\n\n[![GitHub](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/github_vector.svg)](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium)\n[![Modrinth](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/modrinth_vector.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/noisium)\n[![CurseForge](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/curseforge_vector.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/noisium)\n\n![Fabric](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/fabric_vector.svg)\n![Quilt](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/quilt_vector.svg)\n![Forge](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/forge_vector.svg)\n![NeoForge](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium/raw/24de632923c03864d65568a2cb5ce1e2cee0a304/docs/assets/badges/compact/supported/neoforge_vector.svg)\n\nSee the version info in the filename for the supported Minecraft versions.  \nMade for the Fabric, Quilt, Forge, and NeoForge modloaders.

Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2023-06-24T14:46:17.540175Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":874876,"followers":999,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"r6uVoUxU","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.14","version_number":"1.14","changelog":"1.20 fix. works for me","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-24T14:44:16.042293Z","downloads":634898,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"7c6a38565820d9c1941eb9d1aadaae75cb11ed8b","sha512":"892fcccb853e097c3bc11b7205ccd7e99432a6eefee0a6803432d2aa91411eaf0ade9efbd301f5b6991e9efa265cacf67f67518181c3bd2e1ab178e76a4b18c9"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/r6uVoUxU/modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":65430,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar"},"mods\\CITResewn-1.1.3+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"9cd0d8445e65e530cbe1df26809cdf56b84502146f0dd601c47a7ba5df8dd8b861d1cc0344e06cd5277dac71c448376f01ea12be953644ebcba76a8b63befed5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"otVJckYQ","slug":"cit-resewn","project_type":"mod","team":"Je2HSsoZ","title":"CIT Resewn","description":"Re-implements MCPatcher's CIT (custom item textures from optifine resource packs)","body":"<center><img src=\"https://citresewn.shcm.io/img/project_description/logo_shadow.png\" alt=\"CIT Resewn\" width=\"247\" height=\"247\"></center>\n<center>CIT Resewn is MCPatcher's CIT features re-written outside of optifine as a standalone mod for fabric</center>\n\n[<center><img src=\"https://citresewn.shcm.io/img/project_description/docs.png\" alt=\"Go to the docs for more info!\" width=\"268\" height=\"53\"></center>](https://citresewn.shcm.io/)\n\n[<center><img src=\"https://citresewn.shcm.io/img/project_description/link_curse.png\" alt=\"Curseforge\" width=\"135\" height=\"53\"></center>](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cit-resewn)\n\n### Huh? What does it do?\nMCPatcher had a feature called Custom Item Textures(or CIT for short) which was later adopted by Optifine.\n\nCustom Item Textures allowed resourcepacks to replace the appearance of items when they met certain conditions.\n\nCIT Resewn does exactly that but as a standalone Fabric mod which does not require MCPatcher nor Optifine!\n\nOn top of that, CIT Resewn aims to build upon the concept of CITs by expanding the available types and conditions.\n\n### How is it different than MCPatcher/Optifine's CIT?\nCIT Resewn is intended to be fully backwards compatible with the old Optifine/MCPatcher packs. Though there are some key differences.\n\nFirst, the numeric id system was removed since the Flattening. Packs utilizing the so called \"magic numbers\" instead of the new text ids will not work.\n\nSecond, Optifine and old minecraft versions have a bug which allows resourcepacks to put files in malformatted(or \"broken\") paths.<br>\nThese are paths that contain \"Non (lower cased) a-z, 0-9, dots, underscores and dashes\" characters within either the file name or its parent directories. In the case that you must use such a broken pack, there is a compromise set up which is still highly experimental and not recommended. You can go to CIT Resewn's settings and allow broken paths. (I'm serious, this is not recommended at all)\n\nLastly, to ensure compatibility with foreign packs, CITs will be loaded from .properties files under:\n`assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/optifine/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/mcpatcher/cit`\n\n### Does CIT Resewn support Optifine/Sodium?\nWhile CIT Resewn is designed to work without any performance mod needed, I will try my best to ensure it is compatible with Sodium.\n\nWith all that said, there will not be support for Optifine at all.\n\nThere were also discussions around Sodium alternatives such as Canvas.<br>\nMy official statement on compatibility with these mods is \"if it works it works\" unless I say otherwise.\n\n### What about Forge?\nForge is being kinda doodoo recently and Fabric's Mixins is what allows the mod to inject cits into vanilla so smoothly.\n\nDo not ask for a forge port or I'll break your elbows.\n\n### 1.16/other versions?\nSee [Issues#120](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues/120)\n\n<strike>If a version says it's for 1.x, it means it is aimed to work on all of 1.x's minor versions but specifically recommended for its listed minor version.</strike><br>\nWell not anymore!

essential for traversing terrain and preventing falls","body":"# Gliders\n\nWelcome to the world of Gliders!\n\nGliders are the first mod in a vanilla-friendly mod pack designed to enhance the adventure and exploration aspect of Minecraft. These gliders can be crafted from basic materials like wood, iron, and gold, as well as more advanced materials like diamond and netherite. They were introduced to prevent players from rushing to The End to get Elytra.\n\nA good player/server experience was the main focus while designing these Gliders. They were created to be a balanced item, not feeling as overpowered as elytra but with several upgrades to stop the need to rush to go get wings. These gliders will help you navigate the world, explore caves, and prevent falling off cliffs. \n\nWith countless hours of development, this excellent early to mid-game alternative to the Elytra offers an immersive single and multiplayer experience, including first and third-person animations designed to enhance the player's Minecraft experience. Try it out and glide through the skies of Minecraft!\n\n## Features\n\n### Tiers\n\nWhen it comes to Gliders, you have a variety of options to choose from. You can opt for a wooden glider, which is perfect if you're just starting out and want to get a feel for gliding. If you're looking for something that's more durable, you might want to consider an Iron or Gold Glider. If you're willing to splurge, then Diamond Gliders are a great choice as they are very durable and offer a significant increase in flight time. And for those who want the ultimate gliding experience, Netherite Gliders are the way to go. These gliders are incredibly durable and offer the longest flight time of all the Glider tiers.\n\nTo craft a Glider, you'll need to start by creating reinforced paper, a new type of paper that is used in the construction of these amazing flying machines. Reinforced paper is a unique material that is made by combining conventional paper with other materials such as leather, iron, gold, diamond, or netherite scrap depending on the desired strength of the glider. The crafting process is relatively straightforward and involves combining standard paper with the appropriate materials in a crafting table. Once you have the reinforced paper, you can then use it to craft the glider of your choice.\n\n### Updrafts\n\nWhen utilizing gliders in Minecraft, it's important to note that fire and magma are not typically friendly elements. However, there is a way to utilize these elements to your advantage. By using a Glider, you'll notice wind particles emanating from heat sources. These updrafts of heat can provide you with a substantial boost in height, allowing you to glide over treacherous terrain with ease. However, it's essential to exercise caution when using gliders in other HOT dimensions, as the conditions may be too intense for the glider to handle without the proper upgrades.\n\n### The Right Kind Of Charge\n\nWhen using Glider, it is important to keep a few things in mind. Gliders are made using metal components, and unfortunately, when flying in an open space in the rain, it means you are a prime target for lightning. Therefore, it is not advised to fly in the rain or during a storm. If you want to risk it, you may hear the glider start tingling with a static charge until you are inevitably struck by lighting, dropping you out of the sky and probably breaking your glider. Thankfully, you may be able to replace the metal on your Glider and pared with curtain crystals there may be a modification that can turn the lightning into a useful upgrade instead of a pesky nuisance.\n\n### Glider Repair\n\nWhen using a glider, it's important to be cautious and aware of its delicate structure and using the Glider incorrectly may break it. But don't worry, there is still hope for your beloved Glider. To repair it, you can use a new piece of reinforced paper that matches the material of the original Glider. \n\nTo start the repair process, use a smithing table and use the damaged Glider along with the newly crafted reinforced paper to repair it. But be careful and use the Glider in moderation, as even with upgrades, if its durability eventually reaches zero, it will be lost forever.\n\n### Upgrades\n\nGlider technology has come a long way, with many upgrades available to extend the life of this amazing invention before moving on to the Elytra. These upgrades are designed to allow glider users to explore new environments and terrains that were once impossible to navigate. With these upgrades, the glider becomes a more versatile tool for everyday adventuring. In addition, you can enchant your glider with Mending and Unbreaking enchantments to ensure it lasts as long as possible. With all these upgrades and enchantments, your glider will become an indispensable companion on all your adventures.\n\n### Perspective Changes\n\nIf you're using gliders in Minecraft, you may find that certain situations are easier to navigate in F5 mode. With this in mind, we've added a new feature that allows you to toggle your camera to switch to F5 mode when using a glider.\n\nThis feature is especially useful when you're trying to explore new environments. Gliding with a glider can be a lot of fun and very cinematic, but it can also be challenging to get the right perspective when you're trying to dodge obstacles or maneuver through tight spaces. By switching to F5 mode, you'll be able to see everything around you more clearly, which will make it easier to avoid obstacles and stay on course.\n\nTo activate this feature, simply go to the Controls panel within the Minecraft pause menu and look for the Glider Perspective option. Once you've found it, you can toggle it on or off depending on your preferences. This feature is currently turned off by default, but it worth trying to see what you prefer, If you're new to gliding, you may want to leave this feature turned off until you get more comfortable with the basics of gliding. However, if you're an experienced glider pilot, you may find that this feature is a must-have for your adventures.\n\nPause &gt; Options &gt; Controls &gt; Glider Perspective \n\n### Compatibility\n\nOne of the best things about these gliders is their compatibility with other mods like Create and Curios. Gliders are stylized to work well with the Create Mod . Create is a mod that allows players to build complex contraptions and machinery using gears, belts, and other components. The Glider mod is designed to work seamlessly with Create, allowing players to incorporate gliders into their machinery and contraptions. This means that players can use their gliders in a variety of ways, such as creating glider launchers or incorporating them into their transportation systems.\n\nIn addition, Gliders are designed to work with Curios. Curios is a mod that allows players to equip items in their inventory as accessories. This means that players can equip their Glider as an accessory, allowing them to glide through the skies without having to worry about taking up valuable inventory space like a chest pieces slot.\n\nOverall, gliders are an excellent addition to Minecraft, providing players with a unique and exciting means of transportation. With their impressive durability and a variety of tier options available, players can customize their glider to suit their specific needs. So why not give gliders a try and soar through the skies of Minecraft today?\n","published":"2023-01-19T19:21:49.300441Z","updated":"2024-02-07T14:25:17.505032Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":18377,"followers":160,"categories":["equipment","transportation"],"additional_categories":["adventure","game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["ujLo0GsH","9XToMMUs","YVmZpyBd","zHj4eYPM","o6ZKZUy4","Ag4fqAxX","ZpxnuiTS","wukCCm6S","3wSBmBHu","IQaWYxks","khjB5qLh","tlHT9WKt","ScaPoovu","klPNnsOe","WLcGHp5D","a5CG1HeS","WrYjZTyl","PoAjBiBD","CjFIpNvl","UKYjvjnD","Y2kfKvXr","9Qu0MGnH","nVCZVT0i"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XiC6HzoU/cfb76ca2b6b3963084c78bd4ef12cc707eef9964.png"},"version":{"id":"9Qu0MGnH","project_id":"XiC6HzoU","author_id":"YSsyfeZB","featured":false,"name":"🍂 [Fabric] - Gliders - 1.20.1-v1.1.5","version_number":"1.1.5+fabric","changelog":"<h1>Gliders - 1.1.5 - 1.20.1</h1>\n<h3>Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>Fixes crashes when using upgrades</li>\n</ul>\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-07T14:25:09.423364Z","downloads":1895,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ab402975228d7b9bf631e41055685f86e8ffdd8b0a3012b1e9ee004cdf5a2f9dbf9bd13b3ddc6b0d614a815185bc354d21c6a5f8029e15aac4fc8e9b6b99161d","sha1":"32aca155866bfcd0c937603d2efaf1bd4bf18cc8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XiC6HzoU/versions/9Qu0MGnH/vc_gliders-fabric-1.1.5.jar","filename":"vc_gliders-fabric-1.1.5.jar","primary":true,"size":862734,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"rWEz8MvD","user":{"id":"MElz9b37","username":"TommyCBlocks","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/MElz9b37/11cb0d562fecce2447de18aa2c88d81e285586d6.png","bio":null,"created":"2023-01-21T00:22:32.271116Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Commissioner ","ordering":0},{"team_id":"rWEz8MvD","user":{"id":"XGYSZx84","username":"tamlighter","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/XGYSZx84/0792dad2c4400dcc48191b0deeffd6815dec2073.png","bio":null,"created":"2023-04-13T21:11:48.909513Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"rWEz8MvD","user":{"id":"Xp8KgeGF","username":"te-cup","name":"teacup","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64948928?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-06T14:53:26.869436Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"rWEz8MvD","user":{"id":"YSsyfeZB","username":"Jeryn","name":"Suff","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/YSsyfeZB/66c85ad8c422920668ce2e28d83253a63489eca0.png","bio":"Don't Blink!","created":"2021-01-09T10:27:02.756372Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"vc_gliders-fabric-1.1.5.jar"},"mods\\notenoughanimations-fabric-1.7.1-mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"d9729d824f1aac0e4118b65b4f0f81ba7e7fcf3d6c95ad9d98c17a6ad2595ca3e72c1f8b41ead3dfeb550e297d769a2a82ac97533086c15d0f7903dfc7f025e1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"MPCX6s5C","slug":"not-enough-animations","project_type":"mod","team":"Eayl8ao3","title":"Not Enough Animations","description":"Bringing first-person animations to the third-person","body":"# Not Enough Animations \n\nThis mod brings a lot of missing third-person animations from the first-person or modifies them to be better representative to how they should look like or look like in the first-person.

There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2023-12-08T18:45:45.608403Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":522819,"followers":1403,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV","FOe2l0tx","IWVbiEbl","1hOeraaL","4KrRTVvQ","WgDuoe1K","xm11wemG","FgvUosFH","zA1qYB0L","6DoFR4md"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"FgvUosFH","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v2.4.11 ~ 1.20.2","version_number":"2.4.11","changelog":"This is for ALL modloaders 1.20-1.20.2.\n\n# Terralith 2.4.11\n- Emergency hotfix: prevent crash regarding \"regular structure set\"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-08T01:10:08.715317Z","downloads":136184,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ac529b2a6ab9189cc6b6b459fa7b7b85f6e230e4","sha512":"b6bd6e71666dd57e1db19fe7cad85a9e0d9a13a9c6fa839c4e9cb149b12cf855f8f1676c4bc4d9647f1ba32a7a4f40d3f7090de3c5ddd569950c408b8cfd9128"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/versions/FgvUosFH/Terralith_1.20.4_v2.4.11.jar","filename":"Terralith_1.20.4_v2.4.11.jar","primary":true,"size":2478785,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Terralith_1.20.4_v2.4.11.jar"},"mods\\smarterfarmers-1.20-1.8.2-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"c52f667309296bf4733c412824774894ba9d7c562a2cc8818c11b9d4bf2e055e35bbc8e045a8a90c5a8acec4af14f071f5d2c19641e370d9c31f95d8ffcec7df","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Bh6ZOMvp","slug":"smarter-farmers-farmers-replant","project_type":"mod","team":"p0y6SQY5","title":"Smarter Farmers (farmers replant)","description":"Allows villagers to replant the correct seed & allows them to use modded ones","body":"<center>\n\n## Smarter Farmers\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/qdKRTDf8Cv\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/790151253144895508?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Discord&\" alt=\"Supplementaries Discord\"></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/mehvahdjukaar\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=mehvahdjukaar&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/Supplementariez\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Supplementariez?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Twitter&message=Twitter&\" alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOaLLgwzOdbH6rCI7izCptw\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCOaLLgwzOdbH6rCI7izCptw?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Youtube&message=Twitter&logoColor=ff0000\" alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nSmarter Farmers is a very simple mod that makes farmers a bit less dumb\n\nFarmers can now:\n- Interact, plant and replant modded crops\n- Replant crops according to some logic. No longer will they pick the first seed they have but they'll try to replant what they just harvested instead\n- If no crop is being replanted farmers will choose a new crop to plant based on the crops around it. No more lone single patches of carrots n your wheat field!\n- Accept and pick up seeds from said crops & prevent non farmers from doing the same\n- Will equip a hoe while performing their farm task. Its tier depends on their villager level\n- No longer trample farmland\n- Can plant and replant on non non vanilla farmland like blocks, tweaked via a \"farmer_plantable_on\" tag. By default includes blocks like Supplementaries' planter\n- Can harvest special non crop like blocks, tweaked via a \"crop_replaceable\" tag. By default includes stuff like Immersive Weathering's weeds and Overweight Farming and Hefty crops big crop blocks\n- Are immune to sweet berry bush damage\n- In addition all villagers will now accept and breed with any (modded) food item you throw at them\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

Well, now that's possible! MC Dungeons Armors, also known as MCDA, aims to bring all of these armors, and more, from Minecraft Dungeons to Minecraft.\n\n# Content\n![An image showcasing all of the armor from MC Dungeons Armor on armor stands](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/oMitr7dU/images/2d96ab733184d43a577f41d017ece5d9cc4e4680.png)\nRight now, there are 74 new armor sets to the game ranging from the Evocation Robes to mysterious Curious Armor. Most of the non-unique versions have crafting recipes in the Vanilla Recipe Book and they show up in Recipe Viewers such as [Roughly Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) or [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi). Whilst Recipe Viewers are not necessary, they are <em>HIGHLY</em> recommended.\n\n## Related Mods\nWould you like weapons as well?

This is not a bad thing, in and of itself; but it makes it almost impossible to troubleshoot anything whilst still respecting the licencing that sp614x uses. So, out of respect for them so as to not have to explore their code without permission, we simply do not support it. Please consider the following alternatives:\n    - FPS Enhancement and Optimisations -- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) (Fabric); [Rubidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium) (Forge)\n    - Shaders -- [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) (Fabric); [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus) (Forge)\n    - Rendering Compatibility -- [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) (Fabric); [Reforgium](https://modrinth.com/mod/reforgium) (Forge)\n- Q: Can I use your mod in my modpack?\n  - A: Absolutely! I only ask that you provide a link back to this page.\n- Q: I've seen your mod on other sites. Did you post it and are they safe?\n  - A: I have not, nor do I plan to, post my mod on any other sites than Modrinth, Curseforge or our GitHub page. If you have downloaded this mod from somewhere else: \n    1. It isn't from us \n    2. It may have some kind of malicious files or have been modified in some way. I urge you to delete the file, run a full virus and malware scan and, if you want to use MC Dungeons Artifacts, come and download it on Modrinth, CurseForge or from GitHub.\n- Q: 1.12.2?\n  - A: Given the massive strides that have been made with Minecraft's code since 1.12 and the subsequent changes to the underlying code, a 1.12.x port is simply untenible. Please see this [link](https://howoldisminecraft1122.today/) for more information.\n- Q: Will the mod be ported to 1.x.x?\n  - A: MC Dungeons Weapons, MC Dungeons Armors and MC Dungeons Artifacts are only developed for the latest version of Minecraft. Backports should not be expected.\n- Q. Forge?\n  - A. MC Dungeons Artifacts is compatible with Forge by using the following mods: [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector), [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras) and the [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) which are being developed by Su5eD. Please make sure to follow all of their instructions in order to have the best experience.\n  - Note: If you wish to use [Clumps](https://modrinth.com/mod/clumps), please make sure to use the Fabric version as we rely on a method that is not present in the Forge version.\n  - If you are looking for a mod that was specially built for Forge with similar content, please consider checking out [Dungeons Gear](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dungeons-gear) by the_infamous_1.","published":"2023-11-13T05:35:15.060865Z","updated":"2023-11-13T05:45:08.226547Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":80772,"followers":55,"categories":["adventure","equipment","magic"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["NoLGJgGN"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/oMitr7dU/066c6db2a97f7f7fb4806406b45c93a0a7f5ae79.png"},"version":{"id":"NoLGJgGN","project_id":"oMitr7dU","author_id":"RKeVc148","featured":false,"name":"MC Dungeons Armors 5.0.1","version_number":"5.0.1","changelog":"# Changes\n- Fixed bug with Fading Obsidian in the Nether removing Lava Source Blocks","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-13T05:45:09.351054Z","downloads":80772,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"cde337a1e1e1cfb19aab5676b57b3eb182f85ee7","sha512":"413260e7dcd3344a0ac468676effca55abd3a77e58da7526f6cda406b25214a9a80a2fa1cf3728e4e9359977c91f1bf0d749b5d1acfd2fd09008c0a3eb7df834"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/oMitr7dU/versions/NoLGJgGN/mcda-5.0.1.jar","filename":"mcda-5.0.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1089226,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"TggYmc6t","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Wnxd13zP","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nfn13YXA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"pmaQylHH","user":{"id":"RKeVc148","username":"Chronos_Sacaria","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67794130?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-05-25T14:37:02.079073Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"mcda-5.0.1.jar"},"mods\\bellsandwhistles-0.4.5+1.20.1-FABRIC.jar":{"sha512":"5c7207da3badad77a394e54d18cc38f5933ddec60a2d86b223ed3c0dbd89b6fd135774215d79190157b2f60ee5bd644dca81c4e225db2d1ebde1bcdab3e8dcca","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gJ5afkVv","slug":"bellsandwhistles","project_type":"mod","team":"udxpZVn0","title":"Create: Bells & Whistles","description":"Additions and adornments for the modern Create engineer.

In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.\n\n### How does this mod work?\n\n**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**\n\nNormally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.\nThis mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.\n\n**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**\n\nWhen working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.\nFor example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.\n\nInstead, we now access the information through the still saving server.\nSimilarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.\n\nTo keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.\n\nFor some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.\nWe also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.\n\n### Thanks to...\n\n#### Translators:\n- Felix14-v2 (Russian)\n- Cccc-owo (Simplified Chinese)\n- JustAlittleWolf (German)\n- YakisikliBaran (Turkish)\n- Skidamek (Polish)\n- Oondanomala (Italian)\n- Madis0 (Estonian)\n- notlin4 (Traditional Chinese)\n- BurrConnie (Ukrainian)\n- GodGun968 (Simplified Chinese)\n- ImVietnam (Vietnamese)\n- ishi-sama (French)\n- KAGUYA-1137 (Japanese)\n####\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWith the help of [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras) and a custom Mixin Config Plugin, the mixins have been designed to be very non-intrusive while also being very effective.\n\nBecause of that there is currently no known incompatibilities.\n\nIf you do suspect an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](#problems)!\n\n### Problems?\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems, please open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KingContaria/FastQuit/issues)!\n\nMake sure to attach important info like other mods you were using, log- or crash-files and if possible steps to reproduce.\n\nBefore uploading any files make sure to get rid of personal data!

Hopefully this will encourage you to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n### **IMPORTANT, BREAKING CHANGES on _1.2.0(MC1.18.2)_ and _1.3.1(MC1.19)_**\n> **This update is a major upgrade, I recommend that you make a backup of your world before updating to this version, because this version modifies identifiers of entities, blocks and items for pantries that have been renamed to cabinet. The mod will try to migrate, but will delete all pantries placed in inventory and world if it does not succeed to migrate.**\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a *__[Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)__* to help you learn the basics!\n\n\n## Beta Version\n\nThis mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur. If you'd like to play, keep in mind:\n* **Backup your saves often**;\n* Make sure everything is working before adding it to a modpack;\n* Report any issues you find to our **[issue tracker](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)**! It helps us a lot!\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n***Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?***\n> Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n> * Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n> * Remember that this mod is in beta, so keep and eye out for major gameplay changes and additions that may happen between versions.\n\n***Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?***\n> Farmer's Delight will always keep up with the latest version of Minecraft, with temporary support for the previous one. As of now:\n> * The current focus is exclusively on version(s) : 1.19 and 1.18.2;\n> * This mod port will never be backported to any version prior to 1.16.5 (please don't ask further);\n\n***Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?***\n> Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)\n\n\n## Links:\n\n* [Discord for Help and Feedbacks (Fabric version)](https://discord.gg/MskvEhPDQz)\n* [Report Issues](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)\n* [Discord of main mod/author (Forge version)](https://discord.gg/eFsz5SK)\n* [Twitter vectorwing (original forge mod author)](https://twitter.com/vectorwing)","published":"2022-06-18T17:51:27.070187Z","updated":"2023-12-08T13:30:25.991858Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":581628,"followers":1064,"categories":["decoration","food","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["FG4vSwZt","EpdWyovh","cRnlUfGm","yx8C6sef","BYSArmvd","vHfAq5KW","RSpZmgnD","GJJkeGOX","j28o9UzD","buJjlyP3","JMZ3SwVr","4POXSYDm","G8lpe9fB","baQ9tohQ","Zlgy4hSU","TSMy7brE","DzmY31OQ","cyNt2Gp3","lpeIiuMj","YFvijG6F","rlm3hWGx","vzoppMtR","QXYNitXw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4EakbH8e/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"QXYNitXw","project_id":"4EakbH8e","author_id":"8ylDo0gI","featured":true,"name":"1.4.3 -

Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-02-06T00:32:19.293889Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2406889,"followers":5304,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Aouse6P7","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.

A. Q. ❓\n</center>\n\nQ: How the heck does this work?\n> A: Magic.\n\nQ: Is this compatible with other compat mods?\n> A: Yes, I've included a list of many popular compat mods. The mod will do its best not to register stuff that's already in them when they are installed\n\nQ: I'm a mod author, could I use this mod to add support to my blocks?\n> A: Yes! The mod includes a very simple and easy to use API with which modders can register an entire block definition in only 10 lines! The mod will automatically generate all assets automatically\n\nQ: Can you add support for \"x\" wood type?\n> A: Go try the mod\n\nQ: A block type isnt supported, can I add it myself?\n> A: Not directly as registration cant be conditional and cant depend on config files. If you are a modder and know code you can make a pull request to the mod or use the EveryCompatAPI class directly in your mods (check their javadocs & mod modules for info)\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

Well, now that's possible! MC Dungeons Weapons (MCDW) aims to bring all of these weapons, and more, from Minecraft Dungeons to Minecraft.\n\n# Content\n![An image of multiple rows and columns showcasing the weapons from MC Dungeons Weapons](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FZmGDE43/images/ce47b733d99279758a579a1da74a42228844cf14.png)\nRight now, there are about 150 weapons added to the game ranging from flails to katanas to crossbows and bows. They all have crafting recipes in the Vanilla Recipe Book and they show up in Recipe Viewers such as [Roughly Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei) or [EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi). Whilst Recipe Viewers are not necessary, they are <em>HIGHLY</em> recommended.\n\n## Related Mods\nWould you like weapons as well? Well, check out [MC Dungeons Armors](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcda)!\n\nWould you like artifacts as well? Well, check out [MC Dungeons Artifacts](https://modrinth.com/mod/mcdar)!\n\nDo you like the enchanting style of Dungeons? Check out [MC Dungeons Enchanting](https://modrinth.com/mod/mc-dungeons-enchanting)!\n\n[![Banner and link indicating sponsorship by Bisect Hosting](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/9deaa8f0-11c2-41f1-8f4f-32d2493b0912.png)](https://www.bisecthosting.com/Timefall)\n\n# Attributions/Special Thanks\nMC Dungeons Weapons could not have ever existed without the amazing people mentioned below. They were instrumental to the inspiration and education needed to produce MC Dungeons Weapons and the rest of MCDX (the MC Dungeons Suite).\n\n## SeaOfPixels\nThe continuing improvement to the visuals of this mod would not be possible without [Sea of Pixels](https://powerups4u.wixsite.com/seaofpixels). He has licensed his amazing art for MC Dungeons Weapons and has worked with us to balance out some of the issues with MCDW as well. SeaOfPixels has allowed for his amazing models and textures from his resource pack [New Default+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/newdefaultplus) to be used in MCDW. Please show him some support and check it out! If you like CIT texture packs, I'm sure that you'll have a blast!\n\n## Kai1907\nThis mod was inspired by the amazing CIT texturepack by Kai1907, which allows you to have (at least visually) these weapons as well as a variety of other items. Kai1907 allowed for his art to be used in the earlier versions of this mod. Please show him some support and check out his [awesome texturepack](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/minecraft-dungeons-textures-for-minecraft-java-edition/) and his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDWE3OLgQv5w8E0WcNrzWyA).\n\n## LordDeatHunter\nFor helping with a massive amount of aspects of MCDW including the configs and teaching Chronos many of the foundations of Java. LordDeatHunter is probably most well known for [Fabric Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones), which is definitely worth checking out!\n\n## BackupCup\nCup is an amazing pixel artist and is a budding Kotlin programmer. Thanks to them, we have a new suite of icons for MCDX and the icon for MCDW is thanks to them! Please check out their projects [here](https://modrinth.com/user/BackupCup)!\n\n# Localisations/Translations\nWould you like to have MC Dungeon Weapons translated into your language? Please submit your translation on the GitHub page and I'd be glad to add it!\n- English - `en_us` - Chronos_Sacaria\n- English - `en_gb` - Chronos_Sacaria\n- German - `de_de` - Kai1907 & SattesKrokodil (Incomplete as of version 2.0.2)\n- Korean - `ko_ko` - Soochaehwa & gyular\n- Portuguese - `pt_pt` - Chronos_Sacaria (Incomplete as of version 2.0.2)\n- Simplified Chinese - `cn_zh` - Chronos_Sacaria & Kasualix\n- Spanish - `es_es` - Chronos_Sacaria (Incomplete as of version 2.0.2)\n- Russian - `ru_ru` - realpeterpet (Incomplete as of version 2.0.2)\n\n# Showcases\nWe are eternally grateful to those who took the time out of their schedules to cover our mods.

This is not a bad thing, in and of itself; but it makes it almost impossible to troubleshoot anything whilst still respecting the licencing that sp614x uses. So, out of respect for them so as to not have to explore their code without permission, we simply do not support it. Please consider the following alternatives:\n    - FPS Enhancement and Optimisations -- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) (Fabric); [Rubidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium) (Forge)\n    - Shaders -- [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) (Fabric); [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus) (Forge)\n    - Rendering Compatibility -- [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) (Fabric); [Reforgium](https://modrinth.com/mod/reforgium) (Forge)\n- Q: Can I use your mod in my modpack?\n  - A: Absolutely! I only ask that you provide a link back to this page.\n- Q: I've seen your mod on other sites. Did you post it and are they safe?\n  - A: I have not, nor do I plan to, post my mod on any other sites than Modrinth, Curseforge or our GitHub page. If you have downloaded this mod from somewhere else: \n    1. It isn't from us \n    2. It may have some kind of malicious files or have been modified in some way. I urge you to delete the file, run a full virus and malware scan and, if you want to use MC Dungeons Weapons, come and download it on Modrinth, CurseForge or from GitHub.\n- Q: 1.12.2?\n  - A: No, just no.</p>\n- Q. Forge?\n  - A. MC Dungeons Weapons is compatible with Forge by using the following mods: [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector), [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras) and the [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) which are being developed by Su5eD. Please make sure to follow all of their instructions in order to have the best experience. If you wish to use [Clumps](https://modrinth.com/mod/clumps), please make sure to use the Fabric version as we rely on a method that is not present in the Forge version.","published":"2023-11-12T22:32:16.148279Z","updated":"2024-02-14T19:01:26.442574Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":54445,"followers":67,"categories":["adventure","equipment","magic"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["F4Nb4xBv","NVyPECBw","AhyZP1zF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/FZmGDE43/278575796297e7198422c51c8096ed7dba613bf1.png"},"version":{"id":"AhyZP1zF","project_id":"FZmGDE43","author_id":"RKeVc148","featured":false,"name":"MC

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only reduce the client / render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-03-03T15:49:49.763780Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1865927,"followers":3134,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"shfvdKKK","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.2","version_number":"3.4.2","changelog":"-

This can be any part of the tree. The sapling will automatically be replaced, by using what the tree drops. There are many checks in the mod, from preventing accidental harvesting of houses made from logs to what leaves should decay.<br><br>By default the harvesting only works when holding the crouch button, but this can be toggled in the config. For more feature examples see below. There are lots of config options to tweak the mod exactly to your liking.</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Features with the default configuration settings:</strong></span><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>All trees, vanilla and modded, can be harvested quickly by crouching and chopping down one block.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The time it takes to chop down a tree is determined by the amount of logs in it.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Leaves will decay very quickly after harvesting a tree.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Saplings will be replaced after the last leaf has been decayed.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Warped trees, in the nether, can be harvested quickly.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Huge mushrooms can also be harvested quickly<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Certain axe types can be exempted from harvesting trees via a blacklist.<br><strong>◉&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Many checks to determine what is a tree and what isn't.

If disabled it's reversed, and only works when sneaking.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>automaticallyFindBottomBlock</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): Whether the mod should attempt to find the actual bottom log of the tree and start there. This means you can break a tree in the middle and it will still completely be felled.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableFastLeafDecay</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, the leaves around a broken tree will quickly disappear.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableNetherTrees</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, the warped stem/crimson trees in the nether will also be chopped down quickly.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableHugeMushrooms</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, giant/huge mushrooms will also be chopped down quickly.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>ignorePlayerMadeTrees</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, trees with leaves placed by players won't be destroyed.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>replaceSaplingOnTreeHarvest</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, automatically replaces the sapling from the drops when a tree is harvested.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>replaceMushroomOnMushroomHarvest</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, automatically replaces the sapling from the drops when a huge mushroom is harvested and 'enableHugeMushrooms' is enabled.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>loseDurabilityPerHarvestedLog</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, for every log harvested, the axe held loses durability.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>loseDurabilityModifier</strong>&nbsp;(default = 1.0, min 0.001, max 1.0): Here you can set how much durability chopping down a tree should take from the axe. For example if set to 0.1, this means that every 10 logs take 1 durability.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increaseExhaustionPerHarvestedLog</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, players' exhaustion level increases 0.005 per harvested log (Minecraft's default per broken block) * increaseExhaustionModifier.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increaseExhaustionModifier</strong>&nbsp;(default = 1.0, min 0.001, max 1.0): This determines how much exhaustion should be added to the player per harvested log.

Increasing this will speed up the fast leaf decay, but costs more processing power per tick.</span><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Axe Blacklist Feature:</strong></span><br>It's possible to only allow certain axes to harvest trees. On first load of the mod a blacklist file is generated. It is located at <strong><em>./config/treeharvester/harvestable_axe_blacklist.txt</em></strong>.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates:

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7.

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling.

functions can be added to the `EMFAnimationApi`\n    - via a `Function<Float, Float>` for simple functions witn 1 argument\n    - via a `BiFunction<Float, Float, Float>` for simple functions with 2 arguments\n    - via a `TriFunction<Float, Float, Float, Float>` for simple functions with 3 arguments\n    - via a `Function<List<Float>, Float>` for functions with a variable amount of arguments provided via a List<Float>\n    - via a  custom function factory if your function requires more complex logic, such as reading the argument strings as a value other than float\n- changed the `unknown model printing` option to `Model exporting` and added options to export all models info to a .jem file or the log, not just the unknown / modded ones\n  - Models now export `Blockbench` ready with correct pivots, boxes, and uvs.\n  - models now export to `.minecraft/emf/export/`\n- implemented `is_on_head`, `is_in_hand` & `is_in_item_frame`, which did nothing before\n- fixed a `\"newstate\" is null` crash\n- added the `Animation LOD distance` setting which allows you to set the distance at which EMF will start skipping animation frames to save performance\n- added the `Retain LOD at low fps` setting which will proportionally reduce the impact of the above LOD setting while the game is running at below 60 fps, as skipped frames can become more noticeable at lower fps\n- reworked the config screen to use sliders where appropriate\n- added `wolf_armor` to the OptiFine name mappings\n- invalid texture overrides will no longer cause the model to fail to load but instead log an error and use the vanilla texture\n- EMF log messages are now prefixed with a shorter `[EMF]`\n- temporarily disabled texture overrides with tridents as they are broken and difficult to troubleshoot\n- added debug render option `Wireframe over texture` which renders both the wireframe and texture of a model together at the same time\n- added debug render option `Wireframe flashing over texture` which renders both the wireframe and texture of a model together at the same time but the wireframe fades in and out\n- emf now correctly reads all texture overrides with the various relative paths set by optifine e.g. `./`, `~/` etc\n- added a config setting *(enabled by default)* that allows EMF to modify the `enhanced block entity (EBE)` mod's config to disable it for block entities that have custom EMF models loaded\n- fixed texture overrides acting weird with feature renderers *(fixes Ewan's entity health bars cem models with villagers)*\n- added `left_ear` & `right_ear` to `head_piglin.jem` which seems to be correct but missing in OptiFine's documentation :/\n- reduced and reworded some of the loading log spam that would worry users *(for example Fresh Animations 1.9 now sends no log errors on load)*\n- added EMF only rotational logic functions for radians and degrees `wrapdeg() wraprad() degdiff() raddiff()`\n  - the `wrap` functions will wrap a rotation value down to it's smallest identical value, e.g. `wrapdeg(370)` will return `10` & `wrapdeg(350)` will return `-10`\n  - the `diff` functions will return the resulting difference between two rotation values factoring in the rotation, e.g. `degdiff(10, 350)` will return `-20` & `degdiff(10, 370)` will return `0` \n- added very many EMF only interpolation animation functions\n  - `catmullrom() quadbezier() cubicbezier() hermite() easeinoutexpo() easeinexpo() easeoutexpo() easeinoutcirc() easeincirc()  easeoutcirc()  easeinoutelastic()  easeinelastic()  easeoutelastic()  easeinoutback() easeinback()  easeoutback()  easeinoutbounce()  easeinbounce()  easeoutbounce()  easeinquad()  easeoutquad()  easeinoutquad()  easeincubic()  easeoutcubic()  easeinoutcubic()  easeinquart()  easeoutquart()  easeinoutquart()  easeinquint()  easeoutquint()  easeinoutquint()  easeinsine()  easeoutsine()  easeinoutsine()`\n  - hermite & catmullrom have 5 args, the bezier's have 4, the rest have 3, and all are used in the same way as `lerp()` with the delta value being the first argument.\n  - this is a good website to get an idea on what most of these look like https://easings.net/\n- `e` variable added\n- fixes for a certain mixin causing crashes\n- EMF now supports modifying modded block entity models which use the vanilla block entity models separately from the vanilla ones\n  - *(e.g. the `lootr` mod's chest now tries to read `modded/lootr/special_loot_chest.jem` instead of conflicting with `chest.jem`)*\n  - enabling the \"print unknown models\" setting will print out these examples to the log\n- completely rewrote the creation of animation Variables and Functions this should reduce memory usage and also allows other mods to add their own variables and functions\n- reworded some of the translations","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-04T10:55:45.200073Z","downloads":5792,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"97c6fbdbc7541bd78df8bee549fad6228a8f74326684b0060c50c8d8dd99a537e307872049e8e747f8312f4b9a76c6f44f793f772fbe94114cfb47408061be6a","sha1":"2b911c43fc30c7a40974a6250b80b12cac8dc94f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/versions/dVfrkFFQ/entity_model_features_fabric_1.20.1-1.3.jar","filename":"entity_model_features_fabric_1.20.1-1.3.jar","primary":true,"size":347910,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"BVzZfTc1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fXLgMy6f","user":{"id":"rLbuLV6t","username":"Traben","name":"Traben","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8456487?v=4","bio":"What even is OptiFine?","created":"2022-01-26T01:51:52.290422Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entity_model_features_fabric_1.20.1-1.3.jar"},"mods\\fabric-seasons-2.3+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"6ec4ca16e70fa95adb516ed984f1da4c009710ee43941b36cb9f441b42d6772de7f9a9c74909d10657b51d8b2a4d158917b7112a2094729949cccf7b8f169e21","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"KJe6y9Eu","slug":"fabric-seasons","project_type":"mod","team":"qABOlhS9","title":"Fabric Seasons","description":"A simple mod that adds seasons to the game, dynamically changing biomes as you play.","body":"<center>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WszJUGI.png\">\n\nA simple mod that adds seasons to the game, dynamically changing biomes as you play.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png\" width=\"143\" height=\"50\">\n\n</center>\n\n### Description\n\nFabric Seasons adds **four seasons** to Minecraft, each lasting 28 in-game days (configurable). The **current season** is defined by the **world time** (using `/time set 0` will reset to day 1 of spring). Each season has its own changes; during the spring, biomes will mostly try to match their original characteristics.\n\nThe mod has 2 components:\n- **Server:** If installed on the server biomes will have different temperatures. (this enables weather changes like snowing and block freezing in the winter). The server component also contains seasonal crops, allowing crops to grow at different speeds according to the season.\n- **Client:** If installed on the client biomes will have different colormaps according to the current season. This is just a visual change and it'll not physically impact your world in any form.\n\nTo get the full experience it's recommended that you install the mod on both the server and the client.\n\n### Seasonal Biomes\n\nBiomes have **different temperatures** depending on the current **season**:\n\n- Cold Biomes will have rain in the summer\n- Temperate Biomes will have snow in the winter\n- Tropical Biomes will have a steady season all year round\n- Hot Biomes will have a rainy season in the winter\n\nDepending on the **original** temperature/precipitation of the **biome**, this behavior can change. \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdYBkgC.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gH5seb5.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Qs600XR.gif\">\n</center>\n\n### Seasonal Crops\n\nCrops will grow at **different speeds** depending on the current **season**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75gqPqS.png\">\n</center>\n\nEach **individual crop** will have a **pre-configured** growth **speed** for one of the four seasons, this is controlled by a **datapack** and can be changed by the user if they want.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dR4OYPT.png\">\n</center>\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)","published":"2021-05-09T15:41:27.109292Z","updated":"2023-08-12T09:38:01.813799Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":493419,"followers":810,"categories":["adventure","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17-pre1","1.17-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.18-rc4","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["LhCaMIzy","jQoWa0il","zQt9Dd2v","McebIuW7","gtoXC9cr","t3cqWJpS","ZSlExvBh","nBxZtduO","k55LHPVG","hNV4laag","UBlv1O6X","JoW6p4c5","tXjlq5P9","SgKuDqln","UYBTrmgB","tjP6OtOn","FWErjNOd","Gil5sfVD","G7yrUl8Y","866aPKAj","k9JfRwVM","3wVgEG0u","7EU0UwXc","rLlocL2I","5yFOnFEL","QlPte8FN","dJtxMqxE","5TNKN9aR","sX1BCX14","hp6m6aJl","uMEzKato"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KJe6y9Eu/7ce47fcb4242493ad069789298400b14f27737ad.png"},"version":{"id":"uMEzKato","project_id":"KJe6y9Eu","author_id":"TPRVvJKm","featured":false,"name":"Fabric Seasons 2.3","version_number":"2.3+1.20","changelog":"A changelog can be found at https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons/commits/","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-12T09:38:04.242253Z","downloads":226223,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6ec4ca16e70fa95adb516ed984f1da4c009710ee43941b36cb9f441b42d6772de7f9a9c74909d10657b51d8b2a4d158917b7112a2094729949cccf7b8f169e21","sha1":"ad7a86f9bf9d2fed80b186422ab5e73bf235f4f8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KJe6y9Eu/versions/uMEzKato/fabric-seasons-2.3%2B1.20.jar","filename":"fabric-seasons-2.3+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":428398,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"qABOlhS9","user":{"id":"TPRVvJKm","username":"D4rkness_King","name":"Luca Argolo","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TPRVvJKm/icon.png","bio":"","created":"2020-12-01T01:52:35.107689Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fabric-seasons-2.3+1.20.jar"},"mods\\PickUpNotifier-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"4303931f804697027186aa97595c03d7503aa0b00934a9133fd35f95ee119352a03c8b8c66515aaabbf1e2c1ac2b120a03800c80da57e03bc12b4e57b47f0807","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ZX66K16c","slug":"pick-up-notifier","project_type":"mod","team":"vMl4tbFC","title":"Pick Up Notifier","description":"Be notified about all the things you've just collected.","body":"<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DCwxKZU.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Vz7MGCN.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

them  \n#### Blender and Blockbench emote creator tools\nmore about this [here](https://kosmx.gitbook.io/emotecraft/tutorial/custom-emotes)  \n[or just download the tools](https://github.com/KosmX/emotes/tree/development/blender)  \n#### Emote server synchronization  \nYou don't need to send the custom emotes to everyone to play them  \n  \n\n## Setup\n\n\"download the mod and put it into the mods folder\"   \nYou need to install the mod both on **both** the **server** and the **client**.  <br>  \nBut You don't need to use the same server and client modloader*  \n*For example emotecraft with a Forge client will work with a Fabric server*  \nYou can also use Bukkit servers, emotecraft-*version*-bukkit.jar is the bukkit plugin  \n  <br>\nWith Emotecraft you can connect to vanilla servers, it just won't do anything.  \n\n## Usage\nby default, press `B` to open the emote choose wheel  \n<br>\nInstall custom emotes by putting them in into `.minecraft/emotes` folder  \n(Just press `Open emotes folder` in the mod's config screen to open the folder in your file browser)\nmore about usage [here](https://kosmx.gitbook.io/emotecraft/manual/manual)\n\n\n\n \n[Emote sharing portal](https://emotes.kosmx.dev/)\n\n---\n*Only with 2.0 and newer Emotecraft

No need for placing the whole box on the ground for checking contents or adding a few item stacks! When you want to extract an item, easily scroll through all items in the box to get what you want. And believe it or not, this works with Ender Chests, too!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0ssWwh-owo\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Shulker Boxes and Ender Chests are so damn useful for storing and transporting many items. But why do you always have to place them on the floor to use them? Time to change that!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In any interface, simply hold shift when hovering the container item and you'll <strong>see all of its contents</strong> in the item tooltip. And if you just quickly want to add a few items, simply <strong>right-click them on the box/chest item in your inventory</strong>. You can do the same without holding an item to <strong>extract items from a box/chest</strong>. To control which item you extract simply use the scrolling wheel to cycle through all the contents. Very useful!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/577/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/578/2022-03-13_10.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Right-click a shulker box item to extract contents stack by stack</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Hold shift to see contents of a shulker box in your inventory</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

through signs and item frames to chests","body":" **Mod on hold warning**\n \n I haven't played Minecraft since 1.16, but I kept my mods updated because people wanted them. Unfortunately, Minecraft changed a lot of internals with 1.19.4, and updating isn't just a matter of changing a few things, it'll also mean figuring out a lot about how it works now. I currently don't have the time and energy to do this, so there won't be a 1.19.4 update in the forseeable future. Sorry for that to everybody who uses my mods.\n \n Some mods (which don't use a gui) will still work, but everything that has a settings or configuration screen won't, so you might still see updates to some of my mods.\n \nAs long as you don't use the config screen, the 1.19.3 version of the mod should still work on 1.19.4.\n\n\nThis mod helps you access containers (chests, shulker boxes, barrels, but also hoppers, dispensers, ...) that are marked with a sign or item frame. Right-clicking a sign or item frame that's attached to a container will open the container instead.\n\nUnlike other similar mods, it's purely client side, so it works on any kind of server - vanilla, modded, or spigot/paper.\n\nYou can still rotate items in item frames by sneaking and clicking them.\n\nThe same goes for signs that have some functionality attached by the server, for example, buy/sell signs on a server that has ChestShop or a similar plugin enabled.","published":"2020-12-12T11:44:27.908567Z","updated":"2024-01-27T12:18:32.473416Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":362091,"followers":1081,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.4","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5","21w03a","21w05a","21w07a","21w08b","21w10a","21w11a","21w13a","21w14a","1.17-pre5","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w39a","21w40a","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre5","1.18","1.18.2","1.19-pre2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w45a","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["h8bGqEhA","VFVct0Df","RAzzHtvo","wYbG1TyG","nxb14Kj8","TDeFdTIS","8o51G2i7","3htKSYvl","C5dkN3yQ","SL26Gyb3","j1JBpo8z","pUmH0Qp4","jSyFHCqu","sSSxl0Ai","jEUeKqWP","peyOaYw9","ZyygREAD","Anv6Fp5Z","Kbn1lNJL","14C7wPMc","bJf4bGiY","s6eVSN6f","puyruYCG","EZAA7MCl","Dz6XIgB2","YQDVV9kV","Rxkd5QRH","BBRbJ4Fd","ZMcunEOm","17Qfgj2T","APnhH1uF","bwQT3Pqa","7BwF68rg","kJBinEft"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Z5b0cAlD/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"bwQT3Pqa","project_id":"Z5b0cAlD","author_id":"m44EmA3V","featured":false,"name":"clickthrough","version_number":"1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1","changelog":"Fix the error message from modmenu when configuring\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-30T07:35:09.841499Z","downloads":121940,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"11b75d1cb1c1d220c180e674156a8e67b4c5cb5f8a2664ab1867be38b947efce029924d1cb28394dbde8d5f8bfceeb7d1a34b3449a298383481227490ec33bbd","sha1":"af4fab0a71ef09870c724a22036437070fb54952"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Z5b0cAlD/versions/bwQT3Pqa/clickthrough-1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1.jar","filename":"clickthrough-1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1.jar","primary":true,"size":95682,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Oab6ZkPT","user":{"id":"m44EmA3V","username":"Giselbaer","name":"Giselbaer","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/243563?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-10T07:06:18.077639Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"clickthrough-1.20-fabric0.83.0-0.4.1.jar"},"mods\\cardinal-components-api-5.2.2.jar":{"sha512":"edb9319211501170deaa29c7752e34910bd578d20ec3724547e6eab84c2bf2a974e3443d759aa24a7db718b1bda673071e8c2c71dbda0ce2f9584f97f09838bc","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"K01OU20C","slug":"cardinal-components-api","project_type":"mod","team":"oRC8ncO9","title":"Cardinal Components API","description":"A data attachment API that is easy, modular, and extremely fast.","body":"# ![Cardinal Components API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnyxStudios/Cardinal-Components-API/1.18/banner.svg)\nA components API for Quilt and Fabric that is easy, modular, and extremely fast.\n\nDetailed information is available in the repository's [**wiki**](https://ladysnake.org/wiki/cardinal-components-api).\nThe information below is a condensed form of the latter.\n\n## Features\\*\n- 🔗 Attach data to a variety of vanilla classes\n- 🧩 Implement once, plug anywhere -

Overly complicated Sound Mod..._\n\n---\n\nThis is the continuation of Huricaaan (Ha3)'s original mod, maintained and updated to the latest version of Minecraft. All previous features have been restored and some new ones added, with new development promised for the future on the opensource github profile!\n\n---\n\nExpect to see a more rich and immersive Minecraft world, one where Presence Footsteps adds new and more dynamic sounds for every block the player walks on. Every block has its own material assigned to it, and can make their own, customized sounds to better match what they're made of.\n\n---\n\n- Wooden chests are creaky and old,\n- stone is dusty and rough.\n- Piston heads sound like wood, whilst their bodies are stone,\n- even cake sounds like you might destroy if you step in the frosting!\n- Tall grass and bristles make a dry, rustling sound as you step through them,\n- Magma sounds like it's literally cooking your souls!\n\n---\n\nNot only that, but the latest version includes step sounds for certain non-block entities:\n\n---\n\nShulkers make the same creaky box noises as Shulker boxes, boats sound like wood, and armour stands creak and produce a stone stepping sound as you walk on their stone slab base.\n\n ---\n\n## Sound Packs\n\nPresence Footsteps is **fully customisable** with resource packs. The mod by default includes a pack with its own sounds\nand material mappings for the vanilla blocks, however if you don't like those sounds or want to use your own, this pack can be turned off\nor used together with packs from the community.\n\nNote that you need **at least one** sounds pack enabled for the mod to function.\n\n![image](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/assets/6429283/9c50aa59-0f59-4324-aab7-cb360acac2ad)\n\n## Mod Support\n\nPresence Footsteps will attempt to figure out the sounds of modded blocks by looking at the vanilla material/sound types they use.\nIf your mod is using very unique sounds though, you can add mappings to your mod to directly control what sounds presence footsteps uses for your block by\nfollowing the [guide on our wiki](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators)\n","published":"2020-12-30T13:18:36.966588Z","updated":"2023-12-18T20:49:45.956801Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1245023,"followers":2236,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.16.1","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b"],"loaders":["fabric","liteloader","quilt"],"versions":["BEtLdX9C","wl2DCPmO","iu4qJBKh","U0g0vHwf","r0Hz3hFo","3R7j6E4Z","20NGWQNM","2Dcs7kJq","cXdGDBED","HSI3wnPT","31QS6G6Z","gLDVmoRt","IUc6dyrf","9ZPyiU8N","3fEb2K4u","GExGOzbi","M7mmrOFn","M7xLhDyx","jxsFtML2","FMF3yzCR","KrTss88l","pOCYcZUF","giebTOyU","teGodXxG","Vt7ls0pO","3JQQCViD","douonZQK","WswrXhsm","LIWEWgbC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"pOCYcZUF","project_id":"rcTfTZr3","author_id":"8a7Nm6u3","featured":true,"name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.9.1","version_number":"1.9.1","changelog":"[Changelog](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/releases/tag/1.9.1)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-25T10:51:43.881502Z","downloads":353364,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e2c171536c326079b46a1f9c7d115f196dade772","sha512":"e90f182812266c2a4e217f292fc79037612e3eed25dc7894824a3772042c7b0d1908c8df63fb17708ca4de5e86e5972d7a929bc9e4697c6bbfc3e6ea31e50027"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/versions/pOCYcZUF/PresenceFootsteps-1.9.1.jar","filename":"PresenceFootsteps-1.9.1.jar","primary":true,"size":7283491,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"JBjInUXM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"GvrerX1T","user":{"id":"8a7Nm6u3","username":"Sollace","name":"­Sollace","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6429283?v=4","bio":"­","created":"2020-12-01T08:11:42.703275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.9.1.jar"},"mods\\PuzzlesLib-v8.1.17-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"ac0074528794fd9f99d1b20fa559fdd4d95ec8abdf9f031ddfec63bd62726d6266e8a11525305090ee8237c97be3c08e937159840cbb3e7c118cca7027abd331","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"QAGBst4M","slug":"puzzles-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"ubZOU9rM","title":"Puzzles Lib","description":"Why's it called Puzzles you ask?

This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

Features\n\n[![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)](https://modrinth.com/mods?e=client)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/950942125225283634?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/traben)\n\n## 🤔 What does this mod do?\n\nETF is a Fabric (Quilt compatible) & Forge mod that adds many new _Entity Texture Features_, including entity and player skin features!\nThis way, ETF achieves more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

page](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/isxander)\n\nA mod that adds the best **controller support** for Minecraft: Java Edition.\n\n</center>\n\n## Why Controlify?\n\n### User friendly\n\nDespite advanced settings available for power users, Controlify is beginner-friendly. It comes by default with\nbutton guides that appear across the whole game, helping you learn the controller layout. It also automatically detects\nyour controller's make and model, displaying relevant Minecraft-style button textures for a more intuitive experience.\nControlify \"just works\" out of the box, no need to spend tens of minutes getting your controller feeling like any other\ngame, thanks to the sane defaults I have created.\n\n### Feature-rich\n\nControlify strives to support all the added features that may come with your controller.\n\n- It supports gyroscopes natively, allowing for precise movements.\n- It comes with vibration/rumble support, making your gameplay more immersive (this is even missing on Bedrock Edition!)\n- Soon, HD haptics support for DualSense controllers, something never seen outside a Playstation game.\n- Support for non-standard joysticks such as flight sticks, given a small amount of setup.\n\n### Compatibility focus\n\nI, the developer have actively collaborated with fellow mod creators of performance mods like Sodium and Iris to\nensure seamless controller functionality throughout these custom GUIs. This will mean a more friction-free environment\nthat lets you focus on playing the game, instead of battling through the menus.\n\n## Q&A\n\n### Does it support Steam Deck?\n\n**Yes!** Controlify has been tested and is fully working on the Steam Deck, and works great. \nHowever, due to limitations with SteamOS, only Steam games can currently interface with the gyroscope and the\nback buttons directly, though [this is set to change in the coming months](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/9148)!\nFor now, you can use Steam Input to convert the gyro into a mouse input, and map the back buttons to other, more common\nbuttons.\n\n### Does it support my controller?\n\nControlify supports most controllers out of the box, any generic gamepad-like controller is bound to work fine, at\nleast in a basic state, giving inputs. Though, more strange and uncommon controllers such as handhelds like the ROG \nAlly may be missing features such as gyroscope.\n\nIf you are having trouble getting your controller working correctly, you can \n[join my discord server](https://short.isxander.dev/discord) or consult \n[the wiki](https://docs.isxander.dev/controlify/users/controller-compatibility-guide) for assistance.\n\n## Features\n\n### Controller vibration\n\nControlify supports controller vibration, which has not been seen before for PC versions of Minecraft,\nincluding Bedrock Windows 10 Edition. Configure the intensity of each vibration source, with\ncomplex vibration patterns for lots of aspects of the game (e.g. when you take damage).\n\n![picture of vibration config](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/8a7809d07d9e1d9e3002007d7e5e13b73ce8fb5b.png)\n\n### Radial menu\n\n![radial menu showcase](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/e56d9be363b2b31440e16018cc01f197848b7ac6.webp)\n\nTo save up some buttons on your controller, dedicate some less-used actions to the radial menu.\nIt is fully customizable through the settings and intuitive to use. Any modded keybind is\ncompatible with this menu.\n\n### Built-in gyro support\n\nControlify has built-in support for controller gyroscopes, allowing you to make fine movements in-game\nwith your controller. This can be combined with [flick stick](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/bw5xct/flick_stick_is_a_new_way_to_control_3d_games_with/) to be able to use a controller without\nthe compromise.\n\n### Container cursor\n\nJust like in bedrock edition, you can move a cursor across your inventory, and interact\nwith it in a controller-friendly way. With dedicated buttons for quick move, dropping etc. Controlify also comes with cursor snapping, so you don't need to be so precise with cursor movements.\n\n![container cursor screenshot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/249a2cbaea9b374b33fe67717380e732693dd37a.png)\n\n### Controller identification\n\nControlify has the ability to identify the make and model of your controller automatically,\nand displays relevant button textures for your controller. This is also extendable by resource packs, changing up the button textures in a different style and adding some of your own, more niche controller identifiers.\n\n![demonstration of data-driven identification](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/ec1408d51787b87525b9fb0f2e56b54c5910d384.png)\n\n### Joystick support\n\nYou can connect any joystick to the mod and map it with your own names and textures, with an unlimited amount of inputs per controller.\n\n### Button guide\n\nThere is a simple overlay in-game that displays the buttons you can press\nbased on your player's state and look direction. This is useful for new players, who\nhave not yet memorised the controls.\n\n![image of in-game button guide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/57c41cee14680c74faf947c5cff355c0af4c35b3.png)\n\nAlso, some GUIs display controller buttons on elements that have a controller shortcut, to easily navigate with a controller like you should be able to.\n\n![image of in-screen button guide](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/511e4182137bb27bbdf95539c8265b9af2038761.webp)\n\n### Containerised Controllers\n\nThis mod is built around the fact that each controller is completely separate, with it's own configuration, bindings etc.\nThis means it will be trivial to add support for split-screen play in the future.\n\n### Built for mod compatibility\n\nGUI operation has been abstracted into a simple API, which allows other mods to easily add support for their own GUIs,\nwithout convoluted support throughout the whole mod's codebase, making it difficult for third parties to integrate.\n\n![demonstration of dabr compat](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/8ee5ec167bc5f8be96da725b10707094559138cb.gif)\n\n*Video recorded using do-a-barrel-roll with a Thrustmaster HOTAS flightstick*\n\n### Automatic controller deadzone calibration\n\nThe deadzone values of your controller are automatically calibrated, \nmeaning you don't have to worry about it.\n\n![image of calibration screen](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/images/f5f8e2a0a05e61adb95dd919760b424165ca5d14.png)\n\n## What is to come?\n\nA few features in various points in the horizon are:\n\n- Explicit Steam Deck support, with the ability to interface with its gyroscope and be able to handle its extra buttons on the back of the device.\n- A better way to change controller bindings, possibly a custom graphical GUI to pick what buttons do what actions, not the other way around.\n- Split-screen support of some degree.\n\n## Backports?\n\nThis mod is only and will only be available for **1.19.4** and above, this is because in 1.19.4, Mojang\nintroduced arrow key navigation which was easily ported to controller, below 1.19.4, this is not possible.\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](/LICENSE).\n","published":"2023-02-05T13:04:45.141986Z","updated":"2024-01-19T08:02:17.125877Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":539891,"followers":301,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["L5wBKwLP","O4X3TycI","XvbPbLuc","ViaGpYcG","mvoRZ4lr","TSgUsWWO","ZshsEOjG","OVsSpUi5","4eYmOLUb","jvUMhWpD","3L7GCFAd","v9yBe6Ye","hA4E3OIW","pKaQjz0y","60bCNc7N","FLIWpoEL","qHzBhRrd","h5ZThJ8W","FXJNOVCT","GJuiYIvz","uPbwSdJT","aT4dMJAD","xncNJgTg","y7xMOOMU","Oquy1mdB","L2JeMo5i","MSWp1Dsg","CzlyUU6C","QPb34aQS","5MMK5oJQ","E0IjfW25","1sbnpZZs","ATnQknqh","2oEDJIbx","6GKVGWLK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DOUdJVEm/4f8cdb3933f9efa0c5dfd5574d3ad6b101c7f3ef.png"},"version":{"id":"CzlyUU6C","project_id":"DOUdJVEm","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"Controlify 1.7.0-beta.1+1.20","version_number":"1.7.0-beta.1+1.20","changelog":"# Controlify 1.7.0 (Beta 1) for 1.20.1\n\nThis patch focuses on stability and controller compatibility.\n\n## Changes\n\n- Switched to Java Native Access (JNA) from Java Native Interface (JNI) for SDL2 native library.\n  - This should fix issues on Linux and macOS when loading SDL2.\n  - This makes adding more features with SDL2 easier in the future.\n- Provided `gamecontrollerdb.txt` to SDL and GLFW to (hopefully) improve controller compatibility.\n- Controller calibration now detects triggers on joysticks.

KOs and/or captures increase nearby shiny rates, and can also give perfect IVs to nearby spawns.","body":"# Unchained\n\nAdd some spice to your Cobblemon world by adding hidden abilities, shiny boosts, guaranteed perfect IVs, and synchronized natures to wild spawning Pokémon, based on the points nearby users have accumulated with KOs, KO streaks, captures, and capture streaks for that Pokémon’s species.\n\n## Features\n\n### Hidden Booster\n\nThe Hidden Booster module gives spawning Pokémon the opportunity to spawn with their hidden ability. Each threshold grants a chance out of `marble` chances that the spawning Pokémon will unlock their hidden ability slot. The default values for `hiddenBoost.json5` make it so that a player who most recently KO’d a given species, or someone who has KO’d at least 99 of a given species will give that species a 1 in 5 (20%) chance to spawn with its hidden ability 64 blocks around that player.\n\n### Shiny Booster\n\nThe Shiny Booster module enhances the likelihood of encountering shiny Pokémon spawns. With each threshold reached, the chances of encountering a shiny Pokémon during spawn increase. The default settings of `shinyBoost.json5` with Cobblemon's default configuration values give the following shiny spawn rates: 2/8196 for a KO streak of 100+, 3/8196 for 300+, 4/8196 for 500+, and for all other cases 1/8196.\n\n### IV Booster\n\nThe IV Booster module gives spawning Pokémon guaranteed perfect IVs based on the highest of a nearby player’s points. With the default `ivBoost.json5`, a capture streak of 5+ gives 1, 10+ gives 2, 20+ gives 3, and 30+ gives 4.\n\n### Synchronized Natures\n\nThe Synchronized Natures module is a little different; it requires that a nearby player have a Pokémon with the Synchronize ability - optionally in the first slot of their party - in order to influence a nearby spawning Pokémon’s nature. This follows the rules of the out-of-battle effect of Synchronize in the main game. Points are only considered when multiple eligible players are nearby. When choosing a player from the list of eligible players, each player has one chance for every point they have.\n\n### Points\n\nEach module comes with its own config. The first few properties allow you to specify the amount of points awarded for KOs, KO Streaks, captures, and capture streaks. For example, the default config for the IV Booster gives awards 0 points for all but capture streaks, which award 1 point towards the threshold.

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at [@BlayTheNinth](https://twitter.com/BlayTheNinth).","published":"2022-06-14T18:11:16.556742Z","updated":"2024-02-27T16:59:06.255308Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1006336,"followers":599,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["yIf5KdB1","C0Q1coDV","OxgGZ2zM","DIjNWWDQ","3FaeA4B3","pLCLIILr","KHoU8dQ1","U6WiexwY","KGco8pn9","3gG05xht","yCm0MvD8","bv4c7vz6","HaskpkVN","rLFLPShY","vtPaYjej","jLBnf4l1","i5Q1d7Pr","TQMftlzA","ZI4feWbU","SLR7Xv0p","AhzvhBQj","oqGuqpwK","DENsCzBf","nErKcTp9","xAQtenTo","1pxcbuZv","840UhUoL","9XoBRgjV","6X6csbpx","nFs2ZvOR","NhlpDRNn","zq3nXKQW","TbFmWuAA","O2nbMbp5","C60k8eYK","XYqAzGqP","XNus763a","qUWyGBdD","RAATKbAN","uATqqu4e","lRKNKP0w","ONL5pq9r","FDkt1ohj","o7IqP6Td","DAOUt1Jg","VYTPVkW0","RXK9iX99","wiayzjLV","rbUpGzGA","i8CwYuCi","I5betUED","NRF4uKO7","c1GjX2k1","Zq0Ko2UQ","d7a0S3hj","l551HLmO","BLkvfQ2x","CO57SmJl","ffUlrjOr","jdk8u9nq","x70MCuv3","sBs7NeXN","BJ0Uk3Di","fFosgnEu","qHXzOzUv","YL5MVHnr","N4NxIVYC","jPAtAJcJ","RYxPLFUw","NMOJStju","qIAY6mKt","JUrMdJP1","VIE9sG8O","f6LbzxNL","TGc6wvHK","lt2lEcIY","1hau5QwF","VH4LTqFp","H0a9rBTV","6ryA9MPE","Q0xpW61Y","hDWb6gW2","7rTXTEe7","uZyJkfxk","SLbLamWu","ZuihLitZ","C95JH5YK","zXq0pj5R","VhfHxcat","2OHf9GyZ","QiuQRA7s","kjIgNYGA","tC2vMFuQ","AUJXa9xo","v1tAteat","fzqus8s0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"v1tAteat","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"7.2.2+fabric-1.20.1","version_number":"7.2.2+fabric-1.20.1","changelog":"- Fixed some models on Fabric not being loaded correctly","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-27T16:55:44.894512Z","downloads":10715,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a1aa70bab410c4fb274591f4bf2fcf69ca5a83fdd4b7682f9e93de79d9f45d6c7ae4452593b34fa59376ed45374dcea38071af7f323b55fb8eb53b4480a98720","sha1":"ce3a8468cddcd1bb40e60958e809e003a85a20c2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MBAkmtvl/versions/v1tAteat/balm-fabric-1.20.1-7.2.2.jar","filename":"balm-fabric-1.20.1-7.2.2.jar","primary":true,"size":380905,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"c1tw4qzj","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"balm-fabric-1.20.1-7.2.2.jar"},"datapacks\\Repurposed_Structures-Better_Witch_Huts_v4.zip":{"sha512":"79ab2bded214b6be32185f59fee5a242ec668f84ccff5049a086b3bd2bb5a44c013d7f9d4fb6d9f7f602ef8ca07cd862777d3ec59456dc4ffe77b716b7fffeb2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ePaZVJM4","slug":"repurposed-structures-better-witch-huts-compat","project_type":"mod","team":"5gSchLJz","title":"Repurposed Structures - Better Witch Huts Compat","description":"Change RS Witch Huts to be in Better Witch Hut's style","body":"Add this datapack to the game to add compatibility between Repurposed Structures and Yung's Better Witch huts.

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n# 📈 Benchmarks\n\nThe following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and they show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow.

Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I just installed Easy Magic and it's not working!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> No new capabilities will be added to existing enchanting tables. You will need to manually break and replace the block. Same goes for converting enchanting tables back to vanilla after removing the mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: The new button for rerolling enchantments added to the enchanting screen is incompatible with my resource pack!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The client config has an option to keep the book from the vanilla screen, the rerolling button will simply not be visible then. Rerolling still works as before, just by clicking the book now.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want anvils to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Anvils</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm using Apotheosis' or Quark's enchanting system, will Easy Magic work as well?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sadly no, Easy Magic only supports the vanilla system and will be overridden by other mods introducing their own.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

integrated vanilla-friendly collection of new dungeons and structures","body":"![](https://i.imgur.com/xHsKaPT.jpg)  \n\n### ⛺ About\n**Explorify** is a mod with new structures to generate and explore in your Minecraft world!  \n\nThe new structures don't only look fairly good (as good as I can make them :P) but should also fit the game thematically and structurally. They're not meant to be just some houses or dungeons, but new things that feel new and interesting while not being too out of place. The main goal is to make exploration more interesting, rewarding, but also just to enrich the stale Minecraft world.  \n\nStructures are also made to be well adapted to surrounding terrain, to not create superflat-like terrain or ugly cliffs in your world. And on top of that, they're properly integrated and should be compatible with all kinds of mods!  \n\nThis is a data pack packaged as a mod, meaning it is fully server-side. You can install it on vanilla servers and have vanilla clients join.  \n\nI hope you like it! More structures will get added over time.  \n\n### 📦 Content\nFor a list of structures with descriptions see the gallery!  \n\n### 📝 Notes\nPlease also know that this mod is still in development and new versions may differ significantly. I might make any changes, including the removal of structures. While Minecraft can handle this and updating the mod will not corrupt your world, it's still best to make backups.  \n\n### ⚙ Configuration\nIf you want to adjust the frequency of structures to your liking, you can use a custom data pack. A template is [available here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/explorify/download/4111372) (for versions v1.19-1.2.x). If you want a structure to not generate at all, remove it from the \"structures\" list inside the relevant file.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2023-12-11T21:15:39.285813Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3252561,"followers":4335,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.8.8","1.8.9","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"BDwHAdWc","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20.2\r\n* Create fr_fr.json by @Calvineries in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* Create vi_vn.json by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Calvineries made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.20...1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T17:08:01.300588Z","downloads":885359,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0080d3733f77e6b2e80e40d5d7bfe63dd125d94984bf92568d3434ff281f68123ec382ee53eba021278c01059299c12492dd518e61de1247f5cf7e8040bc98f1","sha1":"8e4be2bb9703deddb3d3d212c812cdc1f9de072b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/BDwHAdWc/entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":59348,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"Qnt13hO8","username":"tr7zw","name":"tr7zw","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Qnt13hO8/icon.png","bio":"https://tr7zw.dev/","created":"2022-05-04T13:41:52.033912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\extra-mod-integrations-0.4.2+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"3e94b12dd12e2404ceaf61a258e138c436b1e9d2a127a37e7deeabf51a5b0b29292e2d8cfae6c72fffa350b194b35b2bc89c9ea685cb924fcbddd47dc5614495","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"bpRHnWUb","slug":"extra-mod-integrations","project_type":"mod","team":"SSCo6k0T","title":"EMI Addon: Extra Mod Integrations","description":"EMI addon adding support for as many mods as possible","body":"# Extra Mod Integrations\n\nThis mod is an addon for the powerful, new recipe viewer [EMI].

Originally, most of the structures and features in this mod was actually made for my Ultra Amplified Dimension mod. but then I realized these features and structures would look great in the Overworld as well so I decided to take those structures and features and split them into their own mod and continue to add MORE biome variants of vanilla structures! And over time, some other people even help contribute more vanilla styled structures!\n\n<br/>\n\nCheck out the wiki below for all the info! It is kept up to date on latest Repurposed Structures releases.\n\n**[https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/wiki](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/wiki)**\n\n<br/>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Frequently Asked Questions:</b></summary>\n\n- **Q: Can this mod work serverside and let vanilla clients connect?**\n\n  - A: Yep! This mod does not add any new blocks or mobs so it can be ran entirely serverside and is safe for vanilla clients.\n\n- **Q: How do I turn off RS structures in 1.18.2 or newer MC?**\n\n  - A: 1.18.2 did a lot of changes and as a result, all of RS's structures are now in datapack form. <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/wiki/How-to-configure-this-mod\">Click here for more info and leads you to the config datapack</a></span> that lets you turn off structures or changing spawnrates. Don't be afraid to ask me questions if you get stuck!</p>\n  \n- **Q: Does this mod work with <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yungs-better-strongholds\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a>, <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yungs-better-mineshafts-forge\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a>, and other Yungs mods mod?**\n\n  - A: Yes all of Yung's mods will work with Repurposed Structures. Both mod's structures will continue to spawn. Note: RS&rsquo;s structures will remain the same and will not be in the same style as yung&rsquo;s structures unless you put on special datapacks. See the Pre-Datapack section for changing RS's strongholds, dungeons, and other structures to be in the style of Yung's structures! (Mineshafts does not have a datapack because Yung's Better Mineshafts already have biome variants)\n  \n- **Q: Does this mod conflict with ___ mod?**\n\n  - A: Highly unlikely. My mod adds structures to biomes directly so any conflict would be extremely rare. Best way to know is to just try my mod with the other mod. If you find they do conflict somehow, PLEASE let me know so I can investigate and release a fix! :)  In fact, some mods like <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/signpost\">Signpost</a> may have direct compatibility with Repurposed Structures's structures!\n  \n- **Q: I heard this mod has banners in chests but none show up for me. Why?**\n\n  - A: You'll have to use the latest version of Repurposed Structures and have the Luck status effect or attribute. Luck is not able to be obtained in vanilla so you'll have to use another mod or datapack. The banners are more like a cool Easter Egg collectable so check out what mods or datapacks can give you some Luck! Good luck and have fun collecting banners!\n  \n- **Q: The advancements are annoying! I want to turn them off!**\n\n  - A: There are datapacks to turn off the advancements. <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/releases/tag/3.0.0\">Click here for the datapack</a> to use to make all RS advancements disabled. You can delete the files of the structures you do want advancements for from that datapack.\n\n- **Q: How can I change the language that this mod uses?**\n\n  - A: You can use a Resourcepack to add new languages and help contribute! <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/releases/tag/4.0.0\">You can grab this datapack, delete the data folder from it, and use it as a resourcepack and add new languages you want!</a>\n  \n- **Q: Can I use this mod in a modpack?**\n\n  - A: Yep! You can use this mod in a modpack :)\n  \n- **Q: Can I modify the source code of this mod to make changes?**\n\n  - A: You can but just make sure you respect my license which is LGPL. That means, if you plan on distributing a modified Repurposed Structures jar, you should open source it by making the modified source code visible and licensed under an open source license. But truthfully, if you want to make a change, ask me first or make a PR into my mod as I might actually add it to the base mod itself!\n</blockquote></details>\n\n\n***\n\n## **🏠 HOW CAN I CONFIGURE THIS MOD? 🏠**\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>1.18.2 and newer info:</b></summary>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**As of 1.18.2 and newer, most of Repurposed Structures can be changed by datapack now. Including turning off or on structures or changing spawnrates. Click the below link to get an example datapack to edit and some pointers for what to edit to turn off structures. There's a huge amount of stuff you can change by datapack though such as changing what height RS Mineshafts spawn at or how large RS villages are and much more that was not configurable in 1.18.1 and below. Enjoy!**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**<a style=\"font-size: 24px; color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/releases/tag/4.0.0\">Click here to go to config datapack download page</a>**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Note: Be sure to read the instructions in the above link's page to make it easier to know what to edit*\n\nBy default, RS will do its best to import modded loot into its structures's loot. If this is not desired behavior, you can disable this in the normal RS config file in config folder above mods folder.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, you can make datapacks to modify or change how RS structures look! Here's a flat world of all the pieces of my structures. Use this to make editing and overriding structure pieces easier with datapacks: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/releases/tag/1.0.0\">Repurposed Structures - pieces world (click here)</a>**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the expert datapackers, there's actually a hidden neat way to add new pieces to any Jigsaw Structure without overriding their pool file! (Villages, outposts, all of RS's structures minus mansions, etc) For example, instead of overriding `data\\repurposed_structures\\worldgen\\template_pool\\village\\birch\\houses.json` to add new houses to my Birch Village, replace `worldgen\\template` in the datapack with `pool_additions` and have the template pool file only have the entries you want merged into the main pool file. Repurposed Structures will detect these files from ALL datapacks and merge the pool_additions pool entries into the actual template pool file that the path points to. Yes, Repurposed Structures will read all pool_additions files from all datapacks that even have the same path so that the datapacks do not override each other's pool_additions! Neat stuff! And it works with other pools too! Just make sure the piece you are adding has a Jigsaw Block with the right name so the actual structure can connect and spawn the piece.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help you with this cool pool_additions feature, this 18 minute tutorial should help walk you through creating a building, saving it, and adding it to RS's structures with a datapack! **<a class=\"anchor-3Z-8Bb anchorUnderlineOnHover-2ESHQB\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"https://youtu.be/kzRQrQqlYjw\" role=\"button\" href=\"https://youtu.be/kzRQrQqlYjw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/kzRQrQqlYjw</a>**\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>1.18.1 and older info:</b></summary>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**To reach this mod's config file, go into the config folder that is above the mods folder and go into the repurposed_structures-forge folder to change the configs. The config is split up into many files for better organization and ease of editing. Then exit/restart Minecraft for all changes to take effect. Do note that the config will affect all worlds so keep that in mind**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, there are lots of config options. The big one that you may be interested in is the spawnrate config for every structure and yes, you can even fully turn off the structures too. The config comments will help walk you through on how to adjust the rates. Furthermore, you can even blacklist dimensions or biomes as well! For some structures, you can change the maximum and minimum y value that they can start their generation at and far more! Check out the config for everything you can do!\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, you can make datapacks to modify or change a huge amount of stuff in my mod including modifying how structures look! Here's a flat world of all the pieces of my nbt-based structures. Use this to make editing and overriding structure pieces easier with datapacks: **<a href=\"https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/releases/tag/1.0.0\">Repurposed Structures - pieces world (click here)</a>**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to change the loot tables that the structures in this mod uses, you can override my loot tables with a data pack! Here's a datapack with the default loot tables: **<a href=\"https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/0.0.11\">Repurposed_Structures-Loottables (click here) </a>**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mob spawner for all none-nbt based structures can be changed with datapacks as well! You can download the spawner datapack here and change the entries inside the json files to add, remove, or change mob chances in spawners!: **<a href=\"https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/0.0.5\">Repurposed_Structures-Mob_Spawners (click here)</a>**\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all structure pieces such as Wells, Villages, Outposts, Shipwrecks, Pyramids, and Igloos can also be overridden with datapacks. Furthermore, the template pools that holds structure pieces for Villages and other structures can also be overridden with datapacks to add your own pieces to the villages or other structures! You can find what pieces or pools can be replaced and their filenames here but be sure to switch the branch to the MC version you are on: <a href=\"https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/tree/1.16-Forge/src/main/resources/data/repurposed_structures/structures\">Overridable structure nbt files (click here)</a><a href=\"https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/tree/1.16-Forge/src/main/resources/data/repurposed_structures/worldgen\">Overridable structure pool files (click here)</a>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the expert datapackers, there's actually a hidden neat way to add new pieces to any Jigsaw Structure without overriding their pool file!

That means you can customize the blocks in those structures with other mod's blocks or add pieces of other mod's villages into RS's villages! If you decide to use the datapacks below, download it, go into your world's save folder, and put the zipped folder into the datapack folder. Now when you load the game, the datapack should take effect! (Also, you can share mod-compat datapacks you made to me and I'll add it below after I check it out and like it!)\n\nCheck out the wiki below for some links to premade datapacks!\n\n**[https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/wiki#-pre-made-datapacks-](https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/wiki#-pre-made-datapacks-)**\n\n<br/>\n\n***\n\n### Special thanks to:\n\n/r/l-ll-ll-l_IsDisLoss from Reddit for allowing me to use his Nether Pyramid and Nether Crimson Outpost design! \n\n<br/>\n\ncannon_foddr for allowing me to use his Nether Brick Outpost and End/Nether Bricks Shipwreck design!\n\n<br/>\n\nmiguelforge for allowing me to use his Crimson and Warped Shipwreck, End Ruined Portal, Nether Ruins, and other designs!\n<br/>\n\n*If you find an issue, glitch, or have a suggestion about my mod, let me know!

Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n## Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div

Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‘lock’ functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-02-27T22:40:49.584973Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":366024,"followers":629,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"Mkla4B3q","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry On 2.1.2.7","version_number":"2.1.2.7","changelog":"- Fixed Memory Leak\n- Updated default Blacklist\n- Fixed crash with Rats","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-19T22:29:43.157958Z","downloads":133078,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"ca96f56dba50ea4827ec7a15bc590ccb29aba01896550d3cb398bed18acdf469dd351cdc9312e4743f54955b3162e744c58d76c88eb79b1e5e5b4570f5b33c64","sha1":"8f3858977becfbc26f67f4a5579881e15e07d69d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/versions/Mkla4B3q/carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","filename":"carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":443033,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4y59IILI","user":{"id":"5I09DlLz","username":"Tschipp","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649893?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-05T21:43:38.882316Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar.disabled"},"mods\\emi_enchanting-0.1.0+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"d05530225ec2955d7d52c382dde3841967294be9e0f8611bf1a75bf7014eb1ffd7940b8f7ad25970bad97d4ac336cdf1730efa04d0fdd1390b3b5cdfd55d5acc","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"wbWoo11W","slug":"emi-enchanting","project_type":"mod","team":"w98HYGwj","title":"EMI Enchanting","description":"EMI Plugin that gives basic enchantment information; valid items, exlcusions, etc.","body":"![EMI Enchanting Information Example](https://i.imgur.com/zexjeZA.png)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Link](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/85a7141b-76c9-4f0c-bd04-21f4b0d56c4a.webp)](https://bisecthosting.com/fzzyhmstrs)\n\n# EMI Enchanting\n\nEMI Enchanting is a plugin for the [EMI Recipe and Item viewer](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) that displays various information about enchantments.

Adds an option to choose the crafting result if more than one is available.","body":"Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n### Mod Integration\n\n**Note for 1.19.x: Many of these integrations have not been implemented yet on 1.19.x.**\n\n**Just Enough Items**\n\nUpon selecting a recipe to transfer from the Just Enough Item screen, the output will automatically change to match the\nselection if there is more than one possible output.\n\n**Modded Support**\n\nMany crafting tables that are simply variants of the vanilla crafting table will automatically be compatible. Other\ntypes of support may or may not be compatible; below is a list of all mods that Polymorph has specific integration with\nand has already been tested for functionality.\n\n- [Applied Energistics 2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2)\n  - ME Crafting Terminal\n  - ME Pattern Terminal\n- [CraftingCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/craftingcraft)\n  - Portable Crafting\n  - Inventory Crafting\n- [Crafting Station](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-station)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Cyclic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cyclic)\n  - Crafter\n  - Workbench\n- [FastFurnace](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastfurnace)\n  - Furnace\n  - Blasting Furnace\n  - Smoker\n- [FastWorkbench](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastworkbench)\n  - Crafting Table\n- [Iron Furnaces](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-furnaces)\n  - All furnace variants\n- [Pretty Pipes](https://modrinth.com/mod/pretty-pipes)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n- [Refined Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage)\n  - Crafting Grid\n  - Pattern Grid\n- [Refined Storage Addons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/refined-storage-addons)\n  - Wireless Crafting Grid\n- [Simple Storage Network](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-storage-network)\n  - Storage Request Table\n- [Sophisticated Backpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-backpacks)\n  - Crafting Upgrade\n  - Smelting Upgrade\n- [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct)\n  - Crafting Station\n- [Tom's Storage](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage)\n  - Crafting Terminal\n\nPlease request support by opening an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Polymorph/issues).\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","published":"2023-02-03T20:08:37.444573Z","updated":"2023-12-05T07:44:23.596047Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":423707,"followers":331,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["diy4s2XO","66Bkdq05","68l9BR3j","bT9w3gh5","hR8YtS8a","gxwQtnsA","vAv92Cl4","vuRsKlbz","cnPRpn78","tLFw14o5","haoNzeyv","750iJ3hO","rect6WEh","aYxyXMzJ","ChHxCoAb","STYYlkp8","wN8G3kAN","skUakdXR","uAleZkbS","SNlci35k","GKZ6KVfs","6Nyu412V","VQtXcHcR","bIDSNOm5","UlRasi89","l15iQHMn","AWwJD7yS","7L5hC81R","zncS6GGa","pJZr4yc3","8zhVFKEL","Sj0OPjRM","2BAp032A","FBfg7una","E4b6m0sQ","GcFD377O","km82tZAr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/ed244c5829bde539763c7fffb55cb3194a349d66.png"},"version":{"id":"E4b6m0sQ","project_id":"tagwiZkJ","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"polymorph-fabric-0.49.1+1.20.1","version_number":"0.49.1+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/invmovecompats\">CurseForge</a> (Mirror)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nThis is a rewrite of the previously separate Forge and Fabric versions.<br>\nMod compatibilities have been moved into an addon mod: [InvMoveCompats](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMoveCompats)<br>\n\n![demo.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/media/demo.gif)\n\nEnables moving, jumping, sprinting, etc. from within inventories.\n\nAlso hides the darkened background tint in inventories that don't pause the game.\n\nBoth features can be toggled on or off per-inventory in the config menu.\n\nThis mod is client-side, but it may raise alarms if used on servers with anticheat.<br>\nI take no responsibility if you get banned or something because you used this on public servers.\n\n### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/InvMove/releases)\n\nRequires [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) on Forge/Fabric/Quilt.<br>\nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) on Fabric.<br>\nRequires [Quilted Fabric API / Quilt Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) on Quilt.<br>\nFor Fabric, you need [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to be able to open the config screen.<br>\nFor Forge, I also recommend [Game Menu Mod Option](https://modrinth.com/mod/gamemenumodoption) so you can change settings in-game.\n\n## Config (In-game)\n\n#### General:\n- Enable Mod: Enable the entire mod\n- Debug Display: Enables a debug overlay that can help debug compatibility problems.\n\n#### UI Movement:\n- Move In Inventories: Enable movement in inventories<br>\n  There is a keybind you can set to toggle this setting (unbound by default)\n- Allow Jumping: Allow jumping in inventories\n- Sneak Mode: How to handle sneaking in inventories:\n  - Off = No sneaking\n  - Maintain = Keep sneaking if you were when the inventory opened (default)\n  - Pressed = Sneak only while holding the sneak button (can be distracting when shift-clicking)\n- Allow Dismounting: Allow dismounting from mounts in inventories (overrides \"Sneak Mode\" while on a mount)\n- Text Field Disables Movement: Disable movement when a text field is focused (like search bars or in an anvil)\n\n#### UI Background:\n- Hide Inventory Backgrounds: Hides the background tint while in inventories.\n- Pause Screens

You can create multiple maps on the same server address and switch between them either manually or automatically.</li>\n<li>Works in Singleplayer, Multiplayer and on Realms.</li>\n<li>Intuitive interface. Open the map screen by&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">pressing M</strong>. Move the map around with your mouse and zoom in/out using the&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mouse wheel</strong>, similar to Google Maps. All relevant controls are listed in a tooltip on the map screen and you can customize a lot of them.</li>\n<li>Optional automatic multiple world detection on servers.</li>\n<li>Displays chunk claims and ally players from the <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-parties-and-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Parties and Claims</a> mod. Lets you claim or forceload chunks directly from the map.</li>\n<li>Resource pack support.

Although in most cases the mod should perform great by default.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's Minimap</a>&nbsp;integration. The minimap mod will display chunks provided by the world map. The world map mod will display waypoints from the Xaero's Minimap mod.

You can create, edit and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">teleport to the waypoints</strong>&nbsp;without leaving the map interface.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the world map for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this:&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">xaeroworldmap:no_world_map.&nbsp;</em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">xaeroworldmap:no_world_map_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Since version 1.14.0</strong>&nbsp;of the mod, you can open an on-map waypoint menu by clicking the icon in the bottom right corner of the map screen. In the waypoint menu, you can see a list of all your map waypoints from the rendered sets, interact with them with the mouse cursor, filter them by name in a text field. The menu also lets you toggle the visibility of disabled waypoints, toggle rendering all sets and change the current waypoint set. Hovering over the waypoints in the menu also acts as hovering over them on the map: they are highlighted on the map and you can use the right-click or hover controls to interact with them.</li>\n<li>An option to export a map as a PNG image file. The mod tries to export the whole map, so it might not work, if the map is millions of blocks in length. I'm planning to give more options for exporting the map in the future!</li>\n<li>Option to limit your map access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add&nbsp;<em>mapItemId:minecraft:compass&nbsp;</em>anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the map will not work unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-size: 24px; text-decoration: underline;\">Get Xaero's Minimap</span></a></p>\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?\n\n<p>First, exit the server and locate the Minecraft game directory that you're using to play on the server. In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

This allows you to have Minecraft open on one monitor, while using other programs on another monitor - as normally Minecraft minimises when you unfocus it. This mod also adds the Borderless Windowed option to the Video Settings screen, so you can easily disable the mod ingame, and has a configuration menu accessible through Mod Menu.\n\n\nWorks on vanilla servers, and modded servers without the mod installed!\n\n\nThis mod is a rewrite of a Forge 1.12 mod, [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft), however it used to be a fork of that mod (which the 1.12 version of this mod is) - see the bottom of this page for the original description.\n\n\nSee [Borderless Window](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/borderless) by nekeras if you're looking for a similar mod for Forge 1.14+.\n\n\nOn macOS this mod is disabled by default, as it is impossible to position the window above the menu bar, and macOS has better fullscreen support anyway.\n\n\n<details><summary>Old 1.12.2 mod description</summary>\n\nThis is the latest released version (1.6.0) of the mod [Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-windowed-borderless-for-minecraft) by hancin for MC 1.12-1.12.2, plus a fix for window resizing by me, compiled by Brycey92. This fork will be obsolete if [this PR](https://github.com/hancin/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/pull/27) is merged.\n\nThis fixes the bug where the window is not resizable after exiting fullscreen. This is a bug in LWJGL, and is fixed by [Fullscreen Fix](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fullscreen-fix) and in current versions of Forge. However, the existing fixes are not applied to Fullscreen Windowed (Borderless), so this fork fixes it in that mod.\n\nSee the original Github post by Brycey92 [here](https://github.com/Brycey92/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/releases/tag/1.6.0-1).\n\nThe 1.12.2 build had the following links: [Source](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft), [Issues](https://github.com/comp500/Fullscreen-Windowed-Minecraft/issues)\n\n**The 1.12.2 build is licensed under the following license:**\n\nCopyright (c) 2015-2017, David Larochelle-Pratte\\\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\\\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1\\.

Well, now that's possible! MC Dungeons Artifacts (MCDAR) aims to (eventually) bring all of these artifacts, and more, from Minecraft Dungeons to Minecraft.\n\n# Content\nRight now, there are more than 25 artifacts added to the game ranging from the explosive Blast Fungus to protective Totem of Shielding. They have been divided into Villager and Illager artifacts and can be found in either villages, mansions, pillager outposts, or dungeons. These artifacts cannot be crafted as it is assumed that the Villagers and Illagers have exclusive knowledge of how to make these magical items.\n\n## Related Mods\nWould you like weapons as well?

They were instrumental to the inspiration and education needed to produce MC Dungeons Artifacts and the rest of MCDX (the MC Dungeons Suite).\n\n## SeaOfPixels\nThe continuing improvement to the visuals of this mod would not be possible without [Sea of Pixels](https://powerups4u.wixsite.com/seaofpixels). He has licensed his amazing art for MC Dungeons Armor and has worked with us to balance out some of the issues with MCDA as well. SeaOfPixels has allowed for his amazing models and textures from his resource pack [New Default+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/newdefaultplus) to be used in MCDA. Please show him some support and check it out! If you like CIT texture packs, I'm sure that you'll have a blast!\n\nTexture and model used: Lightning Rod\n\n## SattesKrokodil\nSattes made the amazing drop art for the various mobs as well as the crafting art. Check him out at his [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/sattes) or check out the [Adventure Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabric-adventure-pack)! We'd love to see you over there!\n\n## BackupCup\nCup is an amazing pixel artist and is a budding Kotlin programmer. Thanks to them, we have a new suite of icons for MCDX and the icon for MCDAR is thanks to them! Please check out their projects [here](https://modrinth.com/user/BackupCup)!\n\n\n# Localisations/Translations\nWould you like to have MC Dungeon Artifacts translated into your language? Please submit your translation on the GitHub page and I'd be glad to add it!\n- English - `en_us` - [Chronos_Sacaria](https://modrinth.com/user/Chronos_Sacaria)\n- Spanish (Mexican) - `es_mx` - Binaris00\n- Simplified Chinese - `cn_zh` - [Chronos_Sacaria](https://modrinth.com/user/Chronos_Sacaria)\n- Russian - `ru_ru` - Inky & [Iamnotagenius](https://modrinth.com/user/Iamnotagenius)\n\n# Patrons\nWithout my patrons, I would not be able to devote as much time as I do to making these mods.\n\n## Special thanks to\n- Deona (Custom)\n- 7z99 (Claymore)\n- EmmyAllEars (Claymore)\n- purejosh (Sword)\n- OnlyANeko (Sword)\n\n# FAQ\n- Q: Why does MCDAR not work with Optifine?\n  - A: Optifine's code is closed source and extremely invasive. This is not a bad thing, in and of itself; but it makes it almost impossible to troubleshoot anything whilst still respecting the licencing that sp614x uses. So, out of respect for them so as to not have to explore their code without permission, we simply do not support it. Please consider the following alternatives:\n    - FPS Enhancement and Optimisations -- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) (Fabric); [Rubidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/rubidium) (Forge)\n    - Shaders -- [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) (Fabric); [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus) (Forge)\n    - Rendering Compatibility -- [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) (Fabric); [Reforgium](https://modrinth.com/mod/reforgium) (Forge)\n- Q: Can I use your mod in my modpack?\n  - A: Absolutely! I only ask that you provide a link back to this page.\n- Q: I've seen your mod on other sites. Did you post it and are they safe?\n  - A: I have not, nor do I plan to, post my mod on any other sites than Modrinth, Curseforge or our GitHub page. If you have downloaded this mod from somewhere else: \n    1. It isn't from us \n    2. It may have some kind of malicious files or have been modified in some way. I urge you to delete the file, run a full virus and malware scan and, if you want to use MC Dungeons Artifacts, come and download it on Modrinth, CurseForge or from GitHub.\n- Q: 1.12.2?\n  - A: Given the massive strides that have been made with Minecraft's code since 1.12 and the subsequent changes to the underlying code, a 1.12.x port is simply untenible. Please see this [link](https://howoldisminecraft1122.today/) for more information.\n- Q: Will the mod be ported to 1.x.x?\n  - A: MC Dungeons Weapons, MC Dungeons Armors and MC Dungeons Artifacts are only developed for the latest version of Minecraft. Backports should not be expected.\n- Q. Forge?\n  - A. MC Dungeons Artifacts is compatible with Forge by using the following mods: [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector), [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras) and the [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) which are being developed by Su5eD.

No more!**\n\nUpgraded backpack can provide about **60 inventory slots** and **2 fluid tanks**, each of which can store up to 6 buckets of fluid or even 24 bottles of potion (Now even more, since it's configurable!). All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - **sort**, **quick stack** and **transfer** to seamlessly manage inventory!\n\n- **Tier Upgrades**\n\nBackpack has to be **upgraded** to reach its maximum storage and tank capacity. Upgrading can be done at a **smithing table** by placing a leather in template slot, higher tier upgrade and a backpack in next slots. Although the backpack can't be directly upgraded to the Netherite tier, it has to be upgraded to all lower tiers first. To reset upgrades, place the backpack on the ground and Shift + Right-click while holding a Blank Upgrade in your hand.\n\n- **Chestplate or backpack? Why not both?**\n\nTraveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios integration is enabled) to be worn. The player can wear one backpack on their back at a time and its inventory can be accessed via the **B** (Configurable) button.\n\n- **The best gear for adventures!**\n\nYou are able to use crafting inside the backpack's inventory or pull out the sleeping bag whenever you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also it's worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described on Wiki). The fluid tanks, in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described on Wiki) provide good portable fluid storage.\n\n- **Customization that you have never seen!**\n\nChoose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! 1.16+ versions provide **dyed backpack**. You can combine whichever dyes you want to create a unique look!\n\n![end travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/E1YYiRf.png)\n\n## Backpacks and Inventory Preview\n<details>\n<summary>Click</summary>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cRRnmSb.png\" alt=\"all backpacks showcase\" height=\"650\" width = \"584\"/>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XBB0wlj.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n</details>\n\n![bee travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/HpldKTS.png)\n\n*** \n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ufbnlYZ.png\" alt=\"kinetic hosting banner\" width=\"800\" height=\"281\"/>](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\n## Modpacks\nYou are allowed to use this mod in public/private modpacks.

category.](https://i.imgur.com/0ew58PW.png)\n\n### EMI Loot\n\nEMI Loot is a plugin for the [EMI Recipe and Item viewer](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) that displays loot tables for chests, blocks , and mobs.\n\n \n*EMI Loot is in beta! Please expect features to change and be added as development continues.*\n\n*This mod is for Fabric and Quilt. A Forge port is not planned at this time.*\n\n*All credit goes to EmilyPloszaj for the creation of EMI itself. This is just a plugin.*\n\n[![Join the Discord](https://i.imgur.com/iXATO6K.png)](https://discord.gg/zDbaYmUba2)\n\n#### Wiki\n\nFor guides on how to use the data-driven systems in EMI Loot, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/fzzyhmstrs/EMI_loot/wiki)\n\n#### Notable Features\n\n- Chest loot is sorted by percentage and includes drops added to the loot tables by mods.\n- If a chest has too many loot options to fit onto the screen, EMI Loot will condense the output into lists of items stacked by same-percentage. Hovering over a certain percentage list will show the possible stacks you can expect to get at that probability.\n- Stack sizes shown represent the average item count you can expect to pull at a time (before factoring in the probability).\n- Block drops have been added. These views show the various drops available, split into different categories based on any particular circumstances needed to get that drop (Silk Touch, Shears, etc).\n- Mob drops have been added. Shows drops available split into categories based on circumstances needed to acquire them (only when a mob is on fire, extra with looting, etc)\n\n\n#### Features to come\n- Implement resource-pack driven system for defining custom conditions and how to parse them.\n- Add in fishing and other gameplay loot\n\n\n","published":"2022-09-25T22:13:18.112945Z","updated":"2024-01-29T13:37:19.279133Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":328160,"followers":193,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g010jnKd","YvsiPoNW","sMYv0WU4","rEZyE6x3","hME9LTtZ","iiGhUAPe","UoqcWBE6","dsAxQzyr","R27L5Wrs","dDsA0q1m","AnKDZCEA","nkW4UzlO","OeVpkByV","byhOHBwi","pFHgMv8g","FzY7HsGk","WLrmskq7","TM0YFork","h5EhjjmQ","nH2jMxUZ","finLaORs","8VxvWtcW","b7JoJE05","p0Ugm9eu","odt1Mqrz","YZu0lWye","48q801AN","vWadFDyM","ge7Vbplt","9rpAPYB9","Xn48U1HI","Rp2bjZ9t","mPCfosCw","x6vIf3HD","tR4xqoxp","7rjmttb6","7fjkgVEh","GUbMMJRo","91c49w5V"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/dec44ad1547e774b6fce97a5268f6ff6309ec40a.png"},"version":{"id":"7fjkgVEh","project_id":"qbbO7Jns","author_id":"ANKRvkxl","featured":false,"name":"EMI Loot 0.6.5+1.20.1","version_number":"0.6.5+1.20.1","changelog":"* Fixed Entities in Mob Loot not appearing in their boxes.\n* Fixed some numbers not rounding correctly (2.3423454 -> 2.34)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-25T02:26:57.423395Z","downloads":154661,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d60a2f4410a6a2916f129e71328f181fab7c250024d313e5415b640594019d58a59016e670a2c075256707fe43b15697340f1879f8dae41aa697845f804455b9","sha1":"e6398e3aef04cbe96273e9174601953ab48f5191"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/versions/7fjkgVEh/emi_loot-0.6.5%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"emi_loot-0.6.5+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":351259,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"4mx41ehI","project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"ANKRvkxl","username":"fzzyhmstrs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72876796?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-13T21:42:13.876320Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"emi_loot-0.6.5+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\ctov-beautify-compat-2.0.jar":{"sha512":"327891ba03becb4c2e70a40f09ff86ba8fb28ff0467f6d66901c7a86727464adced54841e32bcf2d96e90745b452bd7159e9f01d5af70d019c1faf101aaa7fc2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"iunZDj0l","slug":"ctov-beautify-compat","project_type":"mod","team":"iCXRO0QM","title":"CTOV - Beautify Compat","description":"Compatibility datapack for beautify mod and CTOV","body":"Add this datapack to the game to add compatibility between CTOV and Beautify.

more</li>\n<li><b>Includes built-in titles for many modded dimensions</b> - Atum, Twilight Forest, Bumblezone, Lost Cities, &amp; more!</li>\n<li>Supports <b>all modded biomes</b></li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom titles with the Waystones mod!</b> Will display a Waystone's title when you're near it (1.18+ Forge only)</li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom sounds</b> when entering new biomes, dimensions, or Waystone regions</li>\n<li>Dimension &amp; biome blacklisting</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Beautiful Custom Dimension Titles \n\n<p>\nTry out the beautiful <a title=\"Visual Traveler's Titles\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/visual-travelers-titles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visual Traveler's Titles</a> resource pack add-on by UnRoman for completely custom dimension titles! It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2. Lang entries for other versions may be available on a different branch.</p>\n\n## Debug commands\n<p>The following commands work in single player worlds if you have sufficient permissions. They can be used to preview what titles will look like when you encounter them in the game.</p>\n\n<p><code>/biometitle &lt;biome&gt;</code><br />\n<code>/dimensiontitle &lt;dimension&gt;</code></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:26:24.670551Z","updated":"2024-02-20T23:18:05.163730Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":291192,"followers":571,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["nIfqKsvT","yLYslqqw","8j6rQRir","U7s0a0fP","olf32JwT","yOjVCeqk","ZA3ahpCR","xcHI86YI","oUSK4sOQ","MbifZGB0","TTAtymNe","zbwk2CBy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/5f218490f1edb9c55fd18e05f52247727117b93f.png"},"version":{"id":"MbifZGB0","project_id":"JtifUr64","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0.2 (Fabric)","version_number":"1.20-Fabric-4.0.2","changelog":"- Added support for the following mods: Mine Cells, Eden Ring, Deeper Darker, Aether, The True Backrooms, VoidZ, Atlantis.  \n- Added partial Chinese and Japanese translations.  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-28T20:30:11.867199Z","downloads":16044,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a8af88107664482f907e5e797156f677e79f96009b834a77f38c184cc651b88db5adac2f4edd8c6945a199157eedd9a366774f7a52458e8286fdbb492d4d8787","sha1":"9698f7347b3c98276e4d4035e731e34e926e82d0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/versions/MbifZGB0/TravelersTitles-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar","filename":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":345764,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ua7DFN59","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"cn94wA70","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":"Nick Young","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar"},"mods\\doubledoors-1.20.1-5.2.jar":{"sha512":"26a395953adc38feb6f39669dc9d74d5866b053f1fdd092ef6eeccdeb5a50188834f1a3518b64b742b26a707c628fbd85b88bc74e11343b5c5f29dddb487e617","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"JrvR9OHr","slug":"double-doors","project_type":"mod","team":"9myZzd0c","title":"Double Doors","description":"🚪 Multiple identical double doors, trapdoors and fence gates can be opened simultaneously.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><center><a href=\"https://serilum.com/\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/description/header/header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"838\" height=\"400\" /></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://curseforge.com/members/serilum/projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/curseforge.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/user/Serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/modrinth.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/patreon.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a> <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@serilum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Serilum/.data-workflow/main/badges/svg/youtube.svg\" width=\"200\" /></a></center></p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Requires the library mod&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:24px\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/collective\" rel=\"nofollow\">Collective</a>.</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;This mod is part of <span style=\"color:#008000\"><a style=\"color:#008000\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/the-vanilla-experience\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Vanilla Experience</a></span>.</strong><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Double Doors is a minimalistic mod which adds the ability for identical double doors, trapdoors and fence gates to be opened simultaneously.

Not only is the selector texture cut off by a couple pixels, but the entire hotbar was actually designed for being raised up off of the bottom of the screen. Restore how it was meant to be and raise it up!</p>\n<p>Please note that, for Minecraft 1.20.2+, Raised requires its own hotbar selector asset, as the GUI atlas was broken up into separate sprites with the hotbar selector now being cut off in texture as well as code!</p>\n<p>Raised features some basic adjustability! Either use the GUI or commands to control the configurable options. See the wiki for more information.</p>\n<p>On the Fabric version, Raised encapsulates the various HUD elements' method calls in the main render method to translate their position on the screen. Mods that inject adjacent to these calls will naturally work, but mods that inject at the head and tail of the render method are also supported. On the Forge version, this works with the HUD elements that are pre-encapsulated by Forge render events. Depending on the game version, it can work with RenderGameOverlayEvent, RenderGuiOverlayEvent, OverlayRegistry, and RegisterGuiOverlaysEvent.</p>\n<p>If you are a mod creator and find that your mod's HUD is not being raised, fear not because Raised supports Object Share on Fabric! See the wiki or use <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/arrows-info\">Arrows Info</a> for an example.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;&nbsp;&times; &minus;</p>\n<p><strong>What does this do?</strong></p>\n<p>It fixes the code that cuts off the selector texture on the bottom. As well, all HUD elements are moved up by two pixels like in Bedrock, otherwise the last row of pixels on the selector would never render!</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you need this?</strong></p>\n<p>If you don't want a broken HUD or want to choose where it is on the screen, then Raised is the mod for you!</p>\n<p><strong>What does it require?</strong></p>\n<p><a

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visual-workbench-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does this work with crafting tables from other mods?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it does, but support has to be manually enabled per block. Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious. What can I do?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Try <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Crafting Tweaks</span></a>, a mod by <a

Overhauled Village","description":"Enhances and creates new villages and pillager outposts, that perfectly fit into your Minecraft world.","body":"**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_HEADER.webp)**\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER1.webp)**\n\n**ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is a mod that adds new and improved villages and pillager outposts to Minecraft.** It is available for both Forge and Fabric, and it works with most world-generation and structure mods. CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\nChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods. Full documentation is [here](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility)\n\nIt also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem.\nMods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n- **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n- **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n- **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default.\n- Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the CurseForge website.\n\nMod integration\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it's compatible. If it isn't yet, It will be. Read this [wiki page](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility) for details!\n\nYou can suggest more mods in my GitHub Issue section.\n</details>\n\n\n![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER5.webp)\n\n[![discord-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/discord-plural_64h.png)](https://discord.gg/JzYEw7PxQv)

Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2712970,"followers":4573,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"unerR5MN","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1

Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine?

Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: Why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed. I recommend [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features).\n</details>\n\n----------\n\n![ToS](https://imgur.com/zqDp5zR.png)\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Terms of Use:</summary>  \n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n**Fresh Animations: Terms & Conditions**\n\n____________________________________________\n\n- By using this resource pack, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions\n- FreshLX is the creator and copyright owner of this resource pack\n- These terms are subject to change at any time\n- These terms only apply if you intend to use the resource pack in your own content you want to share publicly\n- The terms listed on the official project CurseForge, Modrinth, and Planet Minecraft pages, supersede any license, readme or terms/conditions information provided anywhere else, including in the resource pack files\n- Not all the assets/elements of this resource pack are subject to these terms.

bounty boards, giving rewards for collecting different blocks and items.","body":"# Bountiful\n\n \n\n#### This requires [Kambrik](https://modrinth.com/mod/kambrik)!\n\n***\n\n#### Bountiful is a mod centered around a single block called the Bounty Board, and items which appear within: Bounties!\n\n***\n\n\n \n\n### Mechanics:\n\nBounty boards can be found throughout the world in villages, and they'll generate bounties inside of them. These bounties often ask for you to bring back an item, or kill some mobs in return for whatever rewards they're offering. If you can complete the bounty, you just have to bring it back to the bounty board and right click the board to redeem your rewards!\n\n\n### Decrees\n\nThere exists another item as well, called a Decree. A Decree determines what kind of bounties show up on a bounty board. For example, an Armorsmith's Decree makes it so that objectives and rewards related to armor show up on the board (leather, iron, chestplates, boots, etc). You can have up to three decrees on a bounty board at once, and it will mix and match objectives and rewards from all three when new bounties appear!\n\nYou can find new Decrees as rewards for certain bounties, or make your own. Crafting your own will create a random decree when you place it onto the board.\n\n### Bounty Tiers\n\nJust like items, bounties can have different tiers of rarity. Some bounty rewards are more rare than others, and bounties with higher rarity have a better chance of having these more rare rewards! Rarity follows the same pattern as in vanilla: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Epic.\n\n### Reputation\n\nAll bounty boards have their own value associated with them called \"Reputation\". As you turn in more bounties, this number goes up! The higher the reputation, the more often rare bounties show up on the bounty board. Some bounty rewards may not even show up until you reach high enough reputations.\n\n### Compat\n\nCurrently, I've added some support for some items from different Fabric mods. Feel free to suggest compat with other Fabric mods (but I may be stingy! For example: I'm not likely to add compat with items that involve a lot of time to craft, since it may break progression for some modpacks).\n\n \n\nI plan on adding more in the future!\n\n### Why?\n\nI originally made this mod so that I could be given some goals to accomplish, which would stave off boredom. It gives players something to do when they're bored, and a fun way to incentivize crafting items they'd otherwise maybe not be making!\n\n### Help\n\nUntil the wiki is complete, you can get help on [my Discord server.](https://discord.gg/TCsRjJ6vwZ)\n\n#### Credits:\n\nAkiShirai, for the wonderful bounty board block art.","published":"2021-08-29T02:15:45.939419Z","updated":"2024-03-04T06:47:13.142048Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":181623,"followers":326,"categories":["adventure","economy","utility"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18-pre5","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["b745WfGi","FW2gMFWm","s7W0BcY3","yII7Bu5c","vMLc67VP","hYrrBKBT","qFqfFMMO","j44RssVC","RJHSMTU7","b9dZ8adN","2KAmOHQt"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BpwWFOVM/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"qFqfFMMO","project_id":"BpwWFOVM","author_id":"HpLaZ9DK","featured":false,"name":"Bountiful 6.0.3+1.20.1-Fabric","version_number":"6.0.3+1.20.1","changelog":"### Added\n- Implemented the new item group system, so that items will once again show up in creative tabs, as well as in JEI.\n- Added processor lists, so that bounty boards can generate with a different look depending which village it generates in.\n- Added Numismatic Overhaul compat for Fabric.\n- Updated translations.\n- Added a default single localization override for Decrees\n### Fixed\n- Fixed the \"missing ops\" cosmetic issue upon world load.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-17T23:19:01.980803Z","downloads":143769,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d8e5e67712a8b683ae07101a51ad53df0fb24e63","sha512":"147065ea9b24a43d11a6b22fec9733f011695f1ce8e164037185eb3e29f6c7c01787f193f6c0b614ff9c83c07db811567e3842afe2c88bbf39dc2664bd2d029d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BpwWFOVM/versions/qFqfFMMO/Bountiful-6.0.3%2B1.20.1-fabric.jar","filename":"Bountiful-6.0.3+1.20.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":529853,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"s7VTKfLA","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"s10JMAtS","project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"SqVitkHr","project_id":"zfbCkvdZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"qvvDCp9U","user":{"id":"HpLaZ9DK","username":"ejektaflex","name":"Ejektaflex","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23628421?v=4","bio":"I write code!

This mod is entirely client-side, meaning anyone with or without the mod will see the modifications done by it. It only takes advantages of hidden vanilla features and exposes them to the users without doing any breaking changes.\n\nQ: Can I use your mod in/for my modpack/datapack?  \nA: Please do! A credit would be appreciated in your modlist.  \nSimply do not appropriate yourself this mod.\n\nQ: Will this mod ever come to Forge?  \nA: No! This mod is intended to push a little forward the Fabric community, and this is my choice to explicitly not make it available to another mod loader for the time being.  \nHowever, [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/waffle-stomper/Ghostwriter) is a solid alternative for Forge and the book editing part.\n\nQ: Where can I find the source code of the project?  \nA: As of now, nowhere. This project has been a precious opportunity to make myself comfortable again with Java and a good learning process for modding, as much as I would love some help and see how people could contribute in amazing ways, I still want to practice and learn more for future mods.  \nI don't exclude opening the source code later down the line!\n\nQ: Why is your mod named \"Stendhal\"?  \nA: Glad you are wondering! Marie-Henri Stendhal was a renowned French writer born in the 19th century in my hometown in France.\n</details>\n\n## ❤ Upcoming Updates ❤\n\nStendhal is being actively developed and ported to newer Minecraft versions over time.\n\n> **If you would like to give suggestion and follow the development more actively, please join [my Discord Community]**\n\n## ❤ Community ❤\n\nYou can join me on [my Discord Community] to discuss about Stendhal alongside my various projects, whether they are linked to Minecraft modding or not!\n\nIf you would like, feel free to support me on [Ko-Fi], it would make me really happy and motivated!\n\n[![Support me on Ko-Fi!](https://cdn.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=2)][Ko-Fi]\n\n[my Discord Community]: https://discord.gg/6StChT5m2V\n[Ko-Fi]: https://ko-fi.com/nebspacefarer\n","published":"2021-04-03T13:00:28.570722Z","updated":"2023-12-03T11:17:13.306021Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":471331,"followers":591,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["7RZcMviG","6HUcDuYC","FgDI6kIz","ZBI5qTep","tzYc9HNM","mctIoo5p","GegFEZ3h","cSzSbcvJ","FPGndHr3","YzKB2i5W","MAruo7Ba","DRpka5gO","5OcCVJdV","YYMS9LcJ","WEzwowSz","fAaHFHVp","NriKkvat","LUHS9aJ0","apwqGSaK","Vf7GPVNV","XBrcSt3S","Uj1peBrG","GPeTJmd2"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BWloQ9jK/5038b0062081cc4af94eb4dcfdcd2615fa6cbf2f.png"},"version":{"id":"Uj1peBrG","project_id":"BWloQ9jK","author_id":"TXl4HOmY","featured":true,"name":"Stendhal 1.4.1 - Fabric 1.20->1.20.1","version_number":"1.4.1-1.20","changelog":"> 🔢 **Hotfix:** Fixed a crash at startup for Minecraft 1.20.\n\n> 🔢 **Bump:** Hard requirement of Fabric Loader >= 0.14.21.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-13T10:24:38.429409Z","downloads":144410,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"cd2ccedcc75e3b8de7666a40b98621de387b581d45218738ae32c916b963bf1d77f555aa97e7a45ba0de0b4e89e0145364a294ded7411523d1b2882b7739dfa6","sha1":"c057dd5c73912e7249c9de4f894c666ef644ff98"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BWloQ9jK/versions/Uj1peBrG/stendhal-1.4.1-1.20.jar","filename":"stendhal-1.4.1-1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":511969,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"P35VUUuy","user":{"id":"TXl4HOmY","username":"NebSpacefarer","name":"NebSpacefarer","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65596181?v=4","bio":"Developer of 📚 Stendhal\n- 🔢 Usage Ticker\n- ♻️ Quick Player Trade","created":"2021-04-03T12:14:34.541276Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"stendhal-1.4.1-1.20.jar"}},"modrinth_update_version":null}
